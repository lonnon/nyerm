The &lt;acronym&gt; tag should only be used for acronyms; the &lt;a&gt; tag is really what\'s intended for making links.\n\nUsing the wrong tag for the job causes more problems than offending the sensibilities of semantic markup wonks like me. Screen readers and other alternative browser types rely on the semantics of tags like &lt;acronym&gt; and &lt;a&gt; to be used as they were originally intended, and changing how you use these basic tags can cause a real mess for these browsers when they try to figure out how to render the page.\n\nNow, if you want to get all fancy about it while maintaining proper semantics, I suppose you could add scripting to an &lt;a&gt; tag that would pop up some kind of hovertext linky thing, but it\'s still a departure from how most people are used to using the Web, which makes it terrible from an accessibility standpoint.

Powerpoint doesn\'t create faulty logic; faulty logicians do. Not to mention less-than-critical thinkers and writers who inappropriately double-count their sources in order to present compelling \'evidence\' for their arguments. This would include Clive Thompson, for he cites NASA and Edward Tufte as his evidence that PowerPoint is evil--yet the Tufte volume that Thompson references is essentially a critique of NASA\'s faulty usage of PowerPoint, so he\'s only really using Tufte\'s argument as evidence. Check that--he\'s essentially REWRITING Tufte\'s argument as presenting it as his own. Which would therefore place you in that category of misleading evidence double-counters as well, for you claim that Thompson\'s \"compelling argument\" is \"backed up\" by Tufte\'s research--when it simply IS Tufte\'s research.\n',0,'1','','',0,0),(46451,283,'Lonnon','lonnon.foster@gmail.com','http://blog.nyerm.com','207.46.228.16','2003-12-19 11:58:25','2003-12-19 18:58:25','I don\'t think that Powerpoint creates faulty logic. I don\'t even think Powerpoint _creates_ bad presentation design. It does _encourage_ bad presentation design, though. Powerpoint tends to seduce the unwary, or the lazy, into thinking that tossing a few slides together and reading from them constitutes an effective way to communicate.\r\n\r\nAs I stated in my entry, I do think that Powerpoint can be used for effective presentations, if used correctly by someone willing to learn the craft of public speaking. However, it\'s been my experience that far more people use Powerpoint badly than use it effectively.\r\n\r\nI\'ll concede that I\'m double-counting evidence here. However, I\'m primarily using Clive\'s article as a lead-in for personal opinion and experience on the subject of Powerpoint, not as definitive proof of the quality or utility of Powerpoint. I ran across the article, and it compelled me to write down a chunk of my own thoughts that I\'ve had in my head for some time now. My writing here isn\'t particularly rigorous; it\'s a rant, pure and simple.\r\n\r\nIt\'s true that Thompson\'s article doesn\'t present much more than a rewrite of opinions expressed by Tufte. However, it\'s an excellent summary of Tufte\'s thoughts on the matter. I don\'t think that restating someone else\'s opinion is a bad thing, particularly when you agree with that opinion.\r\n\r\nI also have a great deal of respect for the words and ideas of Edward Tufte. His thoughts on information design resonate well with my own views, so I tend to give his arguments a lot of weight. Then again, I didn\'t need help from either Thompson or Tufte to create my personal dislike for Powerpoint.\r\n\r\n\"Powerpoint is evil\" is, perhaps, too strongly worded. However, I like hyperbole; it makes for more interesting writing and keeps me from falling asleep at the keyboard.\r\n',0,'1','','',0,0),(47995,290,'collision detection','','http://www.collisiondetection.net/mt/archives/000656.html','209.68.1.153','2004-01-07 18:48:05','2004-01-08 01:48:05','<strong>Christmas 2003 -- Dr.-Who-style</strong>\n\nOne reason pundits love to make predictions about the future is that one is rarely called to account for accuracy.

How? Bug hunts! Yes, that time-honored tradition (in the time of WordPress, anyway) of everyone pitching in to test patches and report the results, working on solutions to major bugs, and helping to clear out Trac has come around again, and we&#8217;re scheduling not one, but two bug hunts over the next couple of weeks to ensure that everyone has enough time to prepare and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/\">participate</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>#1</strong> &#8211; The first bug hunt of 2.9 will be Thursday through Saturday, November 5-7, 2009. This should give people a few days to plan for it, upgrade their dev environments if they haven&#8217;t been following trunk, and figure out how to allot their time. We&#8217;re stretching over both weekdays and weekend to try and accommodate everyone&#8217;s schedule.</p>\n<p><strong>#2 </strong>- The second bug hunt will be a week later, Saturday through Monday, November 14-16, 2009. This should make it possible for anyone who needs more than a week to set some time aside to participate. This bug hunt will coincide with <a href=\"http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp NYC</a>, where a special Hacker Room will be set aside for people to go and work on 2.9 bug tickets alongside regular core contributors including Mark Jaquith and Matt Martz (sivel from IRC).</p>\n<h4>The Goals</h4>\n<p><strong>Test, test, test existing patches!</strong> You can see all tickets with patches that need testing by checking <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/13\">this report</a>. When you&#8217;ve tested a patch, report your results in the ticket comments, so core committers can see how the patch is faring.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix known bugs! </strong>You can see the bugs that need patches by checking <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/16\">this report</a>. Look for the ones that seem that they&#8217;ll affect the most people or have the biggest impact by being fixed. Edge case bugs should be lower priority.</p>\n<p><strong>Report new bugs! </strong>As you&#8217;re testing out the development version, if you come across a bug, <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/search\">search trac</a> to see if someone has reported it yet. If so, add a comment with your experience to the ticket so we&#8217;ll know it&#8217;s affecting more than one person. If no ticket exists yet, <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket\">create one</a>.</p>\n<p>Core committers will be around (in the #wordpress-dev channel at irc.freenode.com) both weekends to review patches that have been thoroughly tested, answer questions as needed, and give feedback on patches that need more work before being commit-worthy.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve never participated in a WordPress bug hunt before, but you&#8217;d like to get involved, we&#8217;d love to have you join us!

Yes, that time-honored tradition (in the time of WordPress, anyway) of everyone pitching in to test patches and report the results, working on solutions to major bugs, and helping to clear out Trac has come around again, and we&#8217;re scheduling not one, but two bug hunts over the next couple of weeks to ensure that everyone has enough time to prepare and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/\">participate</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>#1</strong> &#8211; The first bug hunt of 2.9 will be Thursday through Saturday, November 5-7, 2009. This should give people a few days to plan for it, upgrade their dev environments if they haven&#8217;t been following trunk, and figure out how to allot their time. We&#8217;re stretching over both weekdays and weekend to try and accommodate everyone&#8217;s schedule.</p>\n<p><strong>#2 </strong>- The second bug hunt will be a week later, Saturday through Monday, November 14-16, 2009. This should make it possible for anyone who needs more than a week to set some time aside to participate. This bug hunt will coincide with <a href=\"http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp NYC</a>, where a special Hacker Room will be set aside for people to go and work on 2.9 bug tickets alongside regular core contributors including Mark Jaquith and Matt Martz (sivel from IRC).</p>\n<h4>The Goals</h4>\n<p><strong>Test, test, test existing patches!</strong> You can see all tickets with patches that need testing by checking <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/13\">this report</a>. When you&#8217;ve tested a patch, report your results in the ticket comments, so core committers can see how the patch is faring.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix known bugs! </strong>You can see the bugs that need patches by checking <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/16\">this report</a>. Look for the ones that seem that they&#8217;ll affect the most people or have the biggest impact by being fixed. Edge case bugs should be lower priority.</p>\n<p><strong>Report new bugs! </strong>As you&#8217;re testing out the development version, if you come across a bug, <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/search\">search trac</a> to see if someone has reported it yet. If so, add a comment with your experience to the ticket so we&#8217;ll know it&#8217;s affecting more than one person. If no ticket exists yet, <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket\">create one</a>.</p>\n<p>Core committers will be around (in the #wordpress-dev channel at irc.freenode.com) both weekends to review patches that have been thoroughly tested, answer questions as needed, and give feedback on patches that need more work before being commit-worthy.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve never participated in a WordPress bug hunt before, but you&#8217;d like to get involved, we&#8217;d love to have you join us!

I couldn&#8217;t sew my way out of a bag, but it&#8217;s true advice for bloggers as well &#8212; a little bit of work on an <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress\">upgrade now</a> saves a lot of work fixing something later.</p>\n<p>Right now there is a worm making its way around old, unpatched versions of WordPress. This particular worm, like many before it, is clever: it registers a user, uses a security bug (fixed earlier in the year) to allow evaluated code to be executed through the permalink structure, makes itself an admin, then uses JavaScript to hide itself when you look at users page, attempts to clean up after itself, then goes quiet so you never notice while it inserts hidden spam and malware into your old posts.</p>\n<p>The tactics are new, but the strategy is not. Where this particular worm messes up is in the &#8220;clean up&#8221; phase: it doesn&#8217;t hide itself well and the blogger notices that all his links are broken, which causes him to dig deeper and notice the extent of the damage. Where worms of old would do childish things like defacing your site, the new ones are silent and invisible, so you only notice them when they screw up (as this one did) or your site gets removed from Google for having spam and malware on it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m talking about this not to scare you, but to highlight that this is something that has happened before, and that will more than likely happen again.</p>\n<p>A stitch in time saves nine. <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress\">Upgrading is a known quantity of work</a>, and one that the WordPress community has tried its darndest to make as easy as possible with one-click upgrades. <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_My_site_was_hacked\">Fixing a hacked blog, on the other hand, is quite hard</a>. Upgrading is taking your vitamins; fixing a hack is open heart surgery. (This is true of cost, as well.)</p>\n<p>2.8.4, the current version of WordPress, is immune to this worm. (<em>So was the release before this one.</em>) If you&#8217;ve been thinking about upgrading but haven&#8217;t gotten around to it yet, now would be a really good time. If you&#8217;ve already upgraded your blogs, maybe check out the blogs of your friends or that you read and see if they need any help. A stitch in time saves nine.</p>\n<p>Whenever a worm makes the rounds, everyone becomes a security expert and peddles one of three types of advice: snake oil, Club solutions, or real solutions. Snake oil you&#8217;ll be able to spot right away because it&#8217;s <em>easy</em>. Hide the WordPress version, they say, and you&#8217;ll be fine. Uh, duh, the worm writers thought of that. Where their 1.0 might have checked for version numbers, 2.0 just tests capabilities, version number be damned. </p>\n<p>The second type of advice is Club solutions; to illustrate, I&#8217;ll quote from <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/29/club_vs_lojack_solutions\">Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s excellent essay on spam 7 years ago, before WordPress even existed</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The <em>really</em> interesting thing about these approaches, from a game theory perspective, is that they are all <a href=\"http://slate.msn.com/?id=2041\" title=\"Slate, August 3, 1997: Property Is Theft: When protecting your own property is stealing from others\">Club solutions, not Lojack solutions</a>.  There are two basic approaches to protecting your car from theft: <a href=\"http://www.theclub.com/\">The Club</a> (or The Shield, or a car alarm, or something similar), and <a href=\"http://www.lojack.com/\">Lojack</a>.  The Club isnâ€™t much protection against a thief who is determined to steal <em>your</em> car (itâ€™s easy enough to drill the lock, or just cut the steering wheel and slide The Club off).  But it is effective protection against a thief who wants to steal <em>a</em> car (not necessarily <em>your</em> car), because thieves are generally in a hurry and will go for the easiest target, the low-hanging fruit.  The Club works as long as not everyone has it, since if everyone had it, thieves would have an equally difficult time stealing any car, their choice will be based on other factors, and your car is back to being as vulnerable as anyone else&#8217;s.  The Club doesnâ€™t deter theft, it only deflects it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Club blog security solutions can be simple (like an .htaccess file) or incredibly complex (like two-factor authentication), and they can work, especially for <em>known exploits</em>. Club solutions can be useful, like using a strong or complex password for your login &#8212; no one would recommend against that. (Another club solution is switching to less-used software on the assumption or more like the software&#8217;s claim that it&#8217;s perfect and more secure. This is why BeOS is more secure than Linux, ahem.)</p>\n<p>In the car world, if someone figured out how to teleport entire cars to chop shops, The Club wouldn&#8217;t be so useful anymore. Luckily for manufacturers of The Club, this hasn&#8217;t happened. Online and in the software world, though, the equivalent happens almost daily.

I&#8217;m not clairvoyant and I can&#8217;t predict what schemes spammers, hackers, crackers, and tricksters will come up with with in the future to harm your blog, but I do know for certain that as long as WordPress is around we&#8217;ll do everything in our power to make sure the software is safe.

I couldn&#8217;t sew my way out of a bag, but it&#8217;s true advice for bloggers as well &#8212; a little bit of work on an <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress\">upgrade now</a> saves a lot of work fixing something later.</p>\n<p>Right now there is a worm making its way around old, unpatched versions of WordPress. This particular worm, like many before it, is clever: it registers a user, uses a security bug (fixed earlier in the year) to allow evaluated code to be executed through the permalink structure, makes itself an admin, then uses JavaScript to hide itself when you look at users page, attempts to clean up after itself, then goes quiet so you never notice while it inserts hidden spam and malware into your old posts.</p>\n<p>The tactics are new, but the strategy is not. Where this particular worm messes up is in the &#8220;clean up&#8221; phase: it doesn&#8217;t hide itself well and the blogger notices that all his links are broken, which causes him to dig deeper and notice the extent of the damage. Where worms of old would do childish things like defacing your site, the new ones are silent and invisible, so you only notice them when they screw up (as this one did) or your site gets removed from Google for having spam and malware on it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m talking about this not to scare you, but to highlight that this is something that has happened before, and that will more than likely happen again.</p>\n<p>A stitch in time saves nine. <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress\">Upgrading is a known quantity of work</a>, and one that the WordPress community has tried its darndest to make as easy as possible with one-click upgrades. <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_My_site_was_hacked\">Fixing a hacked blog, on the other hand, is quite hard</a>. Upgrading is taking your vitamins; fixing a hack is open heart surgery. (This is true of cost, as well.)</p>\n<p>2.8.4, the current version of WordPress, is immune to this worm. (<em>So was the release before this one.</em>) If you&#8217;ve been thinking about upgrading but haven&#8217;t gotten around to it yet, now would be a really good time. If you&#8217;ve already upgraded your blogs, maybe check out the blogs of your friends or that you read and see if they need any help. A stitch in time saves nine.</p>\n<p>Whenever a worm makes the rounds, everyone becomes a security expert and peddles one of three types of advice: snake oil, Club solutions, or real solutions. Snake oil you&#8217;ll be able to spot right away because it&#8217;s <em>easy</em>. Hide the WordPress version, they say, and you&#8217;ll be fine. Uh, duh, the worm writers thought of that. Where their 1.0 might have checked for version numbers, 2.0 just tests capabilities, version number be damned. </p>\n<p>The second type of advice is Club solutions; to illustrate, I&#8217;ll quote from <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/29/club_vs_lojack_solutions\">Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s excellent essay on spam 7 years ago, before WordPress even existed</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The <em>really</em> interesting thing about these approaches, from a game theory perspective, is that they are all <a href=\"http://slate.msn.com/?id=2041\" title=\"Slate, August 3, 1997: Property Is Theft: When protecting your own property is stealing from others\">Club solutions, not Lojack solutions</a>.

I only switched on Friday. The server did do more traffic than normal, but I put that down to <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL29jYW9pbWguaWUvZmxvb2RpbmctaW4tY29yay8=\">the floods in Cork</a>. Weekend traffic was perfectly normal.</p>\n<p>Load on the site is slightly higher, probably because my anti-bot mod_rewrite rules aren&#8217;t working now. Pingdom stats for the site haven&#8217;t changed drastically and I think the Minify plugin stopped working, must debug that this week. Switching web servers is a huge task. I disabled mobile support in Supercache because I need to translate those rules to Nginx ones. A little birdie told me that he&#8217;s going to be writing a blog post on this very subject soon. Here&#8217;s hoping he&#8217;ll put fingers to keys soon.</p>\n<p>Have you switched to Nginx?

In Debian, the default root is &#8220;/var/www/nginx-default&#8221; so put an index.php in there to test things out. Stop Apache and start Nginx (if this is a test server only!) and visit your site. Works? Now to get WordPress and WP Super Cache working.</p>\n<p>Open up /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default in your editor and comment out the text already there with # characters.

The version of Debian I use doesn&#8217;t have gzip support compiled in, but if your system does, take a look at the gzip_static directive. Thanks <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL3R3aXR0ZXIuY29tL3NpdmVsL3N0YXR1c2VzLzU4ODcwMTYxNTU=\">sivel</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, edit /etc/nginx/nginx.conf and make sure the user in the following line matches the user above:\n<pre class=\"brush: plain;\">user www-data;</pre>\n<p>I changed it to &#8220;nobody nogroup&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Now, stop Apache and start Nginx:\n<pre class=\"brush: bash; gutter: false;\">/etc/init.d/apache stop; /etc/init.d/nginx start</pre>\n<p>WP Super Cache will complain about mod_rewrite missing, and you should disable mobile support.</p>\n<p>How has it worked out? I only switched on Friday. The server did do more traffic than normal, but I put that down to <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL29jYW9pbWguaWUvZmxvb2RpbmctaW4tY29yay8=\">the floods in Cork</a>. Weekend traffic was perfectly normal.</p>\n<p>Load on the site is slightly higher, probably because my anti-bot mod_rewrite rules aren&#8217;t working now. Pingdom stats for the site haven&#8217;t changed drastically and I think the Minify plugin stopped working, must debug that this week. Switching web servers is a huge task. I disabled mobile support in Supercache because I need to translate those rules to Nginx ones. A little birdie told me that he&#8217;s going to be writing a blog post on this very subject soon. Here&#8217;s hoping he&#8217;ll put fingers to keys soon.</p>\n<p>Have you switched to Nginx? How has your switch worked out for you?</p>\n<p><strong>Related Posts</strong><ul><li><a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL29jYW9pbWguaWUvd3Atc3VwZXItY2FjaGUtMDg0LXRoZS1nYXJiYWdlLWNvbGxlY3Rvci8=\" rel=\"\">WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector</a></li><li><a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL29jYW9pbWguaWUvd3Atc3VwZXItY2FjaGUtMDg3Lw==\" rel=\"\">WP Super Cache 0.8.7</a></li><li><a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL29jYW9pbWguaWUvd3Atc3VwZXItY2FjaGUtMC05LTUv\" rel=\"\">WP Super Cache 0.9.5</a></li></ul></p> <img src=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?view=1&post_id=89495533\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\";}i:11;a:7:{s:5:\"title\";s:56:\"WordPress.tv: Last Week on WordPress.tv: Nov 15â€”Nov 21\";s:4:\"guid\";s:31:\"http://blog.wordpress.tv/?p=102\";s:4:\"link\";s:84:\"http://blog.wordpress.tv/2009/11/23/last-week-on-wordpress-tv-nov-15%e2%80%94nov-21/\";s:11:\"description\";s:3637:\"<div class=\"snap_preview\"><br /><p>We had another light publishing week here on WordPress.tv last week, but we have the first of a bunch of WordCamp video for you tonight in a special weekend delivery to make up for lost time.</p>\n<p>The one video we did get out for you was the first video to come out of the excellent WordCamp New York City, and it features an awesome concept that came out of the Google Summer of Code.

was not meant to be. I had high hopes for <a href=\"http://intensedebate.com\">Intense Debate</a> but the drawbacks outweighed the positives in our case. I was really looking forward to a few of the features that I thought might bring more interactivity to the blog and encourage readers to have meatier discussions. As you notice below, we have turned off Intense Debate and gone back to the original comment form. Below is a list of the some of the features I was really looking forward to and our experiences with them.</p>\n<p>I would like to preface this discussion by saying that I screwed up the install by adding this blog onto the wrong account and that added to some of our woes. The account bug that followed (we received some help via the support email) was caused by my fat fingering.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Better overall look and feel of the comment section of a blog: I liked the look and feel. The AJAX interface is spiffy and quite versatile.</li>\n<li>Commenter reputation: I really like this feature and this was one of my top priorities for installing ID. I like it and it worked well. Add this to &#8220;last post of commenter&#8221; and it is a killer feature to give good commenters some free publicity.</li>\n<li>Comment voting: Useful for readers who want to join the discussion. Also very useful to determine spamminess of a comment. I found it to add to the community feel and found myself looking for votes on comments in hot posts.</li>\n<li>Social commenting: I saw a bunch of people use various types of profiles to log in and comment. I think this feature added interesting bits of information about commenters and might have prompted more readers to comment. I cannot say for sure. I had trouble staying logged in because of my fat fingering and caused myself some headaches.</li>\n<li>Reply to comments by Email: Useful feature. Did any of my readers use it? I have no clue. Did I use it? No.</li>\n<li>Automatic folding of threads: Does it work? Yes! Does it have the desired effect? No. On Weblog Tools Collection, automatic comment thread folding meant that a lot of relevant comments were overlooked by readers who ended up saying the same things over again and missing much of the conversation. It just did not have the right feel.</li>\n<li>Comment synchronization with the blog: We were able to roll back to the default commenting system because of this feature and are thankful for that. But the comments on hot/active posts were not quite at par with actual activity on the posts. This lack of real time updates resulted in less comments and conversations.</li>\n<li>Ability to add polls to comments: Cool feature in concept, barely used in reality. A relevant poll added to a hot post might get a few results but readers don&#8217;t use that kind of interactivity unless they want to come back and check the results, which is often not the case. Can be done with a plugin.</li>\n<li>Better spam filtering and moderation features: ID adds the ability to use their own filters in addition to Akismet. But I found these to be cumbersome and Akismet not as responsive. I can&#8217;t quite explain this gripe but I can say that too many comments were ending up in moderation and not enough of the ones that I marked as spam were then treated as spam on subsequent attempts. I don&#8217;t think the WordPress feature that allows previous commenters&#8217; comments to be posted without moderation works with IS. Blacklisted words did not appear to work as well as I have come to expect them to work. There is also no way to &#8220;remember me&#8221; on the ID login page, which is annoying.Â  Having to add co-authors on as admins of the blog on ID meant they got bugged with all the Spam and also meant that they had to be registered users. These reasons were probably the most annoying to me and my fellow authors and resulted in us backing out.</li>\n<li>Ability to record video comments: Cool feature but not used at all on this blog. I see <em>some</em> video comments on TechCrunch but our readers just did not care.</li>\n<li>Better comment curation for multi-author blogs: There is no way to send moderation emails to individual authors (which is a pain for multi-author blogs) and the moderation emails were just unfamiliar and not easy to get used to. Again, not fast enough in moderation and approval of comments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the good and the bad above, I also received some disturbing feedback which suggested that some people would not comment on a blog that runs Intense Debate. I have no such qualm and would really like to hear from folks who feel this way. Why this angst?</p>\n<p>In conclusion I have to say that I think Intense Debate was a mixed bag for us. If you are not thoroughly used to the WordPress comments system and do not have tens of thousands of comments, it is worth a shot. The ability to roll back is fantastic for buyers&#8217; remorse and I think there is a lot of potential.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE: And deactivating the plugin was not enough to stop it from acting upon incoming comments. Comments were borked since ID was deactivated yesterday. The plugin files have now been deleted and that seems to allow comments to flow back through.

Before I started out I had an option of using the <a href=\"http://p2theme.com/\" target=\"_blank\">P2 theme</a> to post quick content on it. However, I shelved the idea since I did and do not have much time to customize the P2 theme to match the look and feel of my current site.</p>\n<p>This led to a big dilemma since I wanted 3 things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start a Micro Blog and post quick content on it. </li>\n<li>Make sure that Google Indexes the micro blog content as it does with the other content. </li>\n<li>Create separate feeds for the Micro Blog and the rest of the content. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Well, i was able to do all of these things without having to add new plugins or create a new blog. Here are the steps I followed to do it. Hopefully many of you will find this useful, and in turn also understand how powerful WordPress is when you want to customize it the way you want it to be.</p>\n<h3>Create Categories &amp; Modify Loops to Segregate Content</h3>\n<p>The first few steps include creating a separate category for the Microblog and segregating content accordingly.</p>\n<h4>Create Category for your Microblog</h4>\n<p>The first thing I wanted to do was to segregate the main content from the micro blog content on the home page, so I went ahead and created a new category called â€œMicroblogâ€, where I post all the Microblog content.</p>\n<h4>Exclude Microblog Content from Main Loop</h4>\n<p>After creating a separate category, I needed the content from this category to be displayed separately on the site and not with the regular loop. To do that, you will have to edit your template file for the home page, usually index.php in your WordPress theme directory.</p>\n<p>To do that you will need to add the code given below before checking if posts exist.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<pre><span>   1:</span> query_posts($query_string . <span>\'&amp;cat=-123\'</span>); <span>//excludes micro blog category</span></pre>\n<pre><span>   2:</span> <span>//continue regular WP loop</span></pre>\n<pre><span>   3:</span> <span>if</span> (have_posts()) : </pre>\n<pre><span>   4:</span>   <span>while</span> (have_posts()) : the_post();</pre>\n<pre><span>   5:</span>       <span>//display posts </span></pre>\n<pre><span>   6:</span>   endwhile:</pre>\n<pre><span>   7:</span> <span>else</span> : </pre>\n<pre><span>   8:</span>     <span>//show errors </span></pre>\n<pre><span>   9:</span> endif;</pre>\n</p></div>\n</div>\n<p>The code query_posts&#8230; instructs WordPress to ignore categories which have an id 123.&#160; Please not that you need to provide the minus(-) symbol before the category id. You will need to specify comma separated values to skip multiple categories.</p>\n<h4>Only Display Microblog Content in The Loop</h4>\n<p>Since I wanted Google to index the content from the Microblog, I wanted to display in on the home page, for this I needed to run another loop, which only displays content from the Microblog.</p>\n<p>For that you need to add the following code:</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<pre><span>   1:</span> query_posts(<span>\'category_name=microblog&amp;posts_per_page=5\'</span>); <span>//only display microblog posts</span></pre>\n<pre><span>   2:</span> <span>if</span>(have_posts()) :</pre>\n<pre><span>   3:</span>     <span>while</span>(haveposts()) : the_post();</pre>\n<pre><span>   4:</span>         <span>//show posts</span></pre>\n<pre><span>   5:</span>     endwhile;</pre>\n<pre><span>   6:</span> <span>else</span>:</pre>\n<pre><span>   7:</span>     <span>//show errors</span></pre>\n<pre><span>   8:</span> endif;</pre>\n</p></div>\n</div>\n<p>In this case, the query_posts only fetched posts from a particular category we specified as the category_name and skipped the rest of it.</p>\n<p>Using the above tricks you now have different sections on your blog home page which segregates content based on categories. You can find more information about skipping and querying certain categories by visiting the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Codex entries for The Loop</a>.</p>\n<h3>Creating Different Feeds for Main and Microblog</h3>\n<p>Now that you have been able to separate content from your main blog and the microblog, it is now time to create separate feeds for them. This is much more simpler than segregating content above and only requires few changes in your feed URL.</p>\n<p>For example if your main feed URL is <strong>http://example.com/feed</strong> you will have to change it to <strong>http://example.com/feed?cat=-123</strong>. Similar to the skip rule in the query above, -123 will ignore posts from the category you specify.</p>\n<p>Creating a separate feed for your Microblog is much more simpler, all you need to do is use the current URL for the Microblog category and add /feed to it. Your Microblog feed will be <strong><a href=\"http://example.com/microblog/feed\">http://example.com/microblog/feed</a></strong>. </p>\n<p>Since you are offering multiple feeds, you might also want to add them to your header.php, so browsers with automatic feed discovery can discover all your feeds. To that, remove the regular feed/RSS link tags from your header and add this. Replace the feed URLs with your own.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<pre><span>   1:</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span>=\"alternate\"</span> <span>type</span><span>=\"application/rss+xml\"</span> <span>title</span><span>=\"Techie Buzz RSS Feed\"</span> <span>href</span><span>=\"http://feeds.techie-buzz.com/techiebuzz\"</span> <span>/&gt;</span> </pre>\n<pre><span>   2:</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span>=\"alternate\"</span> <span>type</span><span>=\"application/rss+xml\"</span> <span>title</span><span>=\"Techie Buzz Microblog\"</span> <span>href</span><span>=\"http://feeds.techie-buzz.com/tbmicroblog\"</span> <span>/&gt;</span></pre>\n</p></div>\n</div>\n<p><img title=\"multiple_feeds\" border=\"0\" alt=\"multiple_feeds\" src=\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/multiple_feeds.png\" width=\"214\" height=\"106\" /> </p>\n<p>Doing this will ensure that whenever a user tries to subscribe to you feeds, they will see multiple options as shown above.</p>\n<h3>Posting Quickly to Your Microblog</h3>\n<p>Now that you have your Microblog setup and ready to go, it would be more appropriate that you can quickly post content to it.</p>\n<p>To do that change your default category for posting to â€œMicroblogâ€ and then drag the Quick Press bookmarklet from your Tools menu to your browser bookmarks bar and start posting. Watch the video below to see how you can use Quick Press to quickly post content to your site.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\n<p>The above tricks will not create a <em>real</em> Microblog, but it will eventually help you to segregate content and run multiple smaller blogs within your major blog and offer them to subscribers. I would still prefer to use the P2 theme for the above task, however customizing it to match the look and feel is a lengthy process and hopefully it should be quicker in the future.</p>\n<p>The above tricks might be good or they might not be that good. Do give me your feedback on what you think about it and whether or not your found it helpful.</p>\";s:7:\"pubdate\";s:31:\"Sat, 21 Nov 2009 04:01:56 +0000\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:12:\"Keith Dsouza\";}s:7:\"summary\";s:7322:\"<p>I recently started out with a microblog on <a href=\"http://techie-buzz.com\" target=\"_blank\">my site</a>, where I wanted to quickly share content I find on the Internet.

WP Super Cache is a page caching plugin for WordPress that will significantly speed up your website.</p>\n<p>New in this release are 2 translations. The Spanish translation is by <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL2VxdWlwYWplZGVtYW5vLmluZm8v\">Omi</a> and the Italian by <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL2dpZGliYW8ubmV0Lw==\">Gianni Diurno</a>. Please, if you use their translations, drop by their sites and leave a thank you comment! They&#8217;ve been very patient with me as I fixed gettext bugs and added new text. Both have blogged about the translations if you need to know more: <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL2dpZGliYW8ubmV0L2luZGV4LnBocC8yMDA5LzExLzE4L3dwLXN1cGVyLWNhY2hlLWluLWl0YWxpYW5vLw==\">Gianni</a>, <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL2VxdWlwYWplZGVtYW5vLmluZm8vMTgvMTEvMjAwOS93cC1zdXBlci1jYWNoZS10cmFkdWNpZG8tYWwtY2FzdGVsbGFuby8=\">Omi</a>.</p>\n<p>The second major feature to go in is an &#8220;advanced&#8221; section to the debugger. This allows the plugin to check the front page every 5 minutes to make sure everything is ok. It monitors for 2 very rare problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> Very very occasionally, the front page becomes a gzip file that downloads. It happened here once and I examined the cache file. There was nothing wrong with it. It was perfect. I suspect Apache and mod_rewrite got confused somehow but clearing the cache fixed it. The file generated after was exactly the same size as the old one, so no chance it got &#8220;double gzipped&#8221;.</li>\n<li> In <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL3dvcmRwcmVzcy5vcmcvc3VwcG9ydC90b3BpYy8yMzc0MTU/cmVwbGllcz02MA==\">certain rare cases</a>, where a blog has a static front page, <em>and</em> uses a permalink structure of /%category%/%postname%/, the wrong page may be cached as the front page. Even if your blog satisfies the two conditions above it may not suffer from this problem. I tried it on this blog for a few days and couldn&#8217;t reproduce it at all!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Nevertheless, if you&#8217;re concerned edit your wp-cache-config.php and add this line:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php;\">$wp_super_cache_advanced_debug = 1;</pre>\n<p>Reload the admin page and you&#8217;ll see this added to the debug section:</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL29jYW9pbWguaWUvd3AtY29udGVudC91cGxvYWRzLzIwMDkvMTEvYWR2YW5jZWQtZGVidWcucG5n\" rel=\"\"><img src=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/advanced-debug-300x182.png\" alt=\"advanced-debug\" title=\"advanced-debug\" width=\"300\" height=\"182\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-89495508\" /></a></div>\n<p>If activated, it will check your front page every 5 minutes.

WP Super Cache is a page caching plugin for WordPress that will significantly speed up your website.</p>\n<p>New in this release are 2 translations. The Spanish translation is by <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL2VxdWlwYWplZGVtYW5vLmluZm8v\">Omi</a> and the Italian by <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL2dpZGliYW8ubmV0Lw==\">Gianni Diurno</a>. Please, if you use their translations, drop by their sites and leave a thank you comment! They&#8217;ve been very patient with me as I fixed gettext bugs and added new text. Both have blogged about the translations if you need to know more: <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL2dpZGliYW8ubmV0L2luZGV4LnBocC8yMDA5LzExLzE4L3dwLXN1cGVyLWNhY2hlLWluLWl0YWxpYW5vLw==\">Gianni</a>, <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL2VxdWlwYWplZGVtYW5vLmluZm8vMTgvMTEvMjAwOS93cC1zdXBlci1jYWNoZS10cmFkdWNpZG8tYWwtY2FzdGVsbGFuby8=\">Omi</a>.</p>\n<p>The second major feature to go in is an &#8220;advanced&#8221; section to the debugger. This allows the plugin to check the front page every 5 minutes to make sure everything is ok. It monitors for 2 very rare problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> Very very occasionally, the front page becomes a gzip file that downloads. It happened here once and I examined the cache file. There was nothing wrong with it. It was perfect. I suspect Apache and mod_rewrite got confused somehow but clearing the cache fixed it. The file generated after was exactly the same size as the old one, so no chance it got &#8220;double gzipped&#8221;.</li>\n<li> In <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL3dvcmRwcmVzcy5vcmcvc3VwcG9ydC90b3BpYy8yMzc0MTU/cmVwbGllcz02MA==\">certain rare cases</a>, where a blog has a static front page, <em>and</em> uses a permalink structure of /%category%/%postname%/, the wrong page may be cached as the front page. Even if your blog satisfies the two conditions above it may not suffer from this problem. I tried it on this blog for a few days and couldn&#8217;t reproduce it at all!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Nevertheless, if you&#8217;re concerned edit your wp-cache-config.php and add this line:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php;\">$wp_super_cache_advanced_debug = 1;</pre>\n<p>Reload the admin page and you&#8217;ll see this added to the debug section:</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/plugins/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL29jYW9pbWguaWUvd3AtY29udGVudC91cGxvYWRzLzIwMDkvMTEvYWR2YW5jZWQtZGVidWcucG5n\" rel=\"\"><img src=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/advanced-debug-300x182.png\" alt=\"advanced-debug\" title=\"advanced-debug\" width=\"300\" height=\"182\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-89495508\" /></a></div>\n<p>If activated, it will check your front page every 5 minutes. It&#8217;s not activated by default because these errors only happen to a small number of blogs. I&#8217;ve also noticed that WordPress seems to randomly forget to run the page checker from time to time. I debugged it and the job simply disappears from the wp-cron system!

This indeed happens but on the flip side, Automattic gives a ton back to the project and to the community. For example, I think there is a lot that can be said for the progression of WordPress thanks to the resources that Automattic has been able to provide due to their funding.

Not everything is open because hosted services do not have to abide by the GPL since there is no distribution taking place.

wanted to do something in WordPress but just wasn&#8217;t sure how? In my experience this happens quite often, mostly with people new to WordPress. But, even the experts run into trouble sometimes. Today I thought I&#8217;d start a series of posts which will aim to explain how to do certain things in WordPress. Hopefully this will cover anything from quick tips and simple little functions, all the way up to more complex custom code and the like. So, stick around and you just might learn something. <img src=\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> </p>\n<p>I think I&#8217;ll kick off the series with a couple simple ones&#8230;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h5>Why isn&#8217;t this plugin working with my theme?</h5>\n<p>This is probably one of the most common issues I read about regarding WordPress. Sometimes even more experienced WP<em>ers</em> can get this one wrong. Now, I&#8217;m not saying this is the solution to <strong>all</strong> problems between plugins and themes. Its just that this little bugger is often the culprit.</p>\n<p>Try ensuring that your theme has <code>&lt;?php <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Plugin_API_Hooks\">wp_head</a>() ?&gt;</code> somewhere inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the document. Also, for that matter, make sure it has <code>&lt;?php <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Plugin_API_Hooks\">wp_footer</a>() ?&gt;</code> somewhere in the foot of the document; Before the <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag.</p>\n<p>If your theme lacks these function calls many plugins that manipulate your theme will not be able to hook into the required areas. This can cause many headaches.</p>\n<p>If you have no idea what I&#8217;m talking about, you may be better off having a coder buddy take a look at the theme for you. Or you can also contact the theme author, if the theme you use was created by someone else.</li>\n<li>\n<h5>How come my URLs are yucky?</h5>\n<p>Or, &#8220;<em>How come my URLs look like <code>www.mysite.com?p=123</code> instead of <code>www&#8203;.mysite.&#8203;com&#8203;/my-&#8203;sample-&#8203;post/</code>?</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>This one is right up there with the previous question. I see it all the time. However, more and more web hosts these days support the &#8220;<em>nice</em>&#8221; URLs by default without requiring any extra effort. So, its just a matter of going into the WordPress control panel, changing your Permalink Settings and then saving. Unfortunately, we&#8217;re not all this lucky&#8230;</p>\n<p>The first thing to try would be to contact your web host support and make sure they have whats known as <code>mod_rewrite</code> <em>(or similar functionality)</em> enabled on your account. If such functionality is not available on your web host, and you really need this feature, you may need to upgrade to a new host that does support it.</p>\n<p>If your host does support it and has it enabled on your account, but it still doesn&#8217;t work, you can check that WordPress is able to write to the <code>.htaccess</code> file <em>(which is where all the &#8220;nice&#8221; URL magic happens)</em>.</p>\n<p>For WordPress, on Unix-based systems, the htaccess file should be &#8220;<em><code><a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions#About_Chmod\">CHMOD</a></code>ed</em>&#8221; to at least <code>666</code>. On Windows-based systems the procedure is a bit different. It can be different depending on your particular setup so I won&#8217;t go into that.</p>\n<p>Basically, as was the case with the previous question, you may need to seek help to figure this out. If you don&#8217;t have a code buddy, get one! They are really great to have around. Just make sure you buy them a nice gift for their trouble. <img src=\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> </li>\n<li>\n<h5>Can I have a link to login to WordPress somewhere in my theme?</h5>\n<p>Sure! It&#8217;s actually easier than you might think&#8230;</p>\n<p>Some themes have a link for that already. But, there are also some that seem to lack this obvious and simple feature. You can easily add this to any theme yourself. No need for any programming knowledge. Simply add <code>&lt;?php <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_loginout\">wp_loginout</a>() ?&gt;</code> somewhere in your theme and you&#8217;re done. Easy right?</p>\n<p>Another nice function along the same lines is <code>&lt;?php <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_register\">wp_register</a>() ?&gt;</code>, which will show a link to your registration page <em>(if your settings allow users to register)</em>, or a link to the WordPress control panel if you are already logged in.</p>\n<p>Do note though that by default the link will be output wrapped inside <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tags. This is so you can include the link in a list of other links, like a &#8220;<em>meta</em>&#8221; section. If, however, that is not how you want it to be output you can use the function like <code>&lt;?php wp_register(\'\', \'\') ?&gt;</code>. That will simply output the link and nothing else.</p>\n<p>An example of how to customize that is something like <code>&lt;?php wp_register(\'&lt;p&gt;\', \'&lt;/p&gt;\') ?&gt;</code>, which will output the link wrapped in its own paragraph. Just change the opening and closing tags in the function to make it output how you want. Dead simple!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That&#8217;s all for now&#8230; I hope it helps!</p>\n<p>Do you have a question about WordPress? Want to see it answered here on Weblog Tools Collection?

Or you can also contact the theme author, if the theme you use was created by someone else.</li>\n<li>\n<h5>How come my URLs are yucky?</h5>\n<p>Or, &#8220;<em>How come my URLs look like <code>www.mysite.com?p=123</code> instead of <code>www&#8203;.mysite.&#8203;com&#8203;/my-&#8203;sample-&#8203;post/</code>?</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>This one is right up there with the previous question. I see it all the time. However, more and more web hosts these days support the &#8220;<em>nice</em>&#8221; URLs by default without requiring any extra effort. So, its just a matter of going into the WordPress control panel, changing your Permalink Settings and then saving. Unfortunately, we&#8217;re not all this lucky&#8230;</p>\n<p>The first thing to try would be to contact your web host support and make sure they have whats known as <code>mod_rewrite</code> <em>(or similar functionality)</em> enabled on your account. If such functionality is not available on your web host, and you really need this feature, you may need to upgrade to a new host that does support it.</p>\n<p>If your host does support it and has it enabled on your account, but it still doesn&#8217;t work, you can check that WordPress is able to write to the <code>.htaccess</code> file <em>(which is where all the &#8220;nice&#8221; URL magic happens)</em>.</p>\n<p>For WordPress, on Unix-based systems, the htaccess file should be &#8220;<em><code><a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions#About_Chmod\">CHMOD</a></code>ed</em>&#8221; to at least <code>666</code>. On Windows-based systems the procedure is a bit different. It can be different depending on your particular setup so I won&#8217;t go into that.</p>\n<p>Basically, as was the case with the previous question, you may need to seek help to figure this out. If you don&#8217;t have a code buddy, get one! They are really great to have around. Just make sure you buy them a nice gift for their trouble. <img src=\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> </li>\n<li>\n<h5>Can I have a link to login to WordPress somewhere in my theme?</h5>\n<p>Sure! It&#8217;s actually easier than you might think&#8230;</p>\n<p>Some themes have a link for that already. But, there are also some that seem to lack this obvious and simple feature. You can easily add this to any theme yourself. No need for any programming knowledge. Simply add <code>&lt;?php <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_loginout\">wp_loginout</a>() ?&gt;</code> somewhere in your theme and you&#8217;re done. Easy right?</p>\n<p>Another nice function along the same lines is <code>&lt;?php <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_register\">wp_register</a>() ?&gt;</code>, which will show a link to your registration page <em>(if your settings allow users to register)</em>, or a link to the WordPress control panel if you are already logged in.</p>\n<p>Do note though that by default the link will be output wrapped inside <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tags. This is so you can include the link in a list of other links, like a &#8220;<em>meta</em>&#8221; section. If, however, that is not how you want it to be output you can use the function like <code>&lt;?php wp_register(\'\', \'\') ?&gt;</code>. That will simply output the link and nothing else.</p>\n<p>An example of how to customize that is something like <code>&lt;?php wp_register(\'&lt;p&gt;\', \'&lt;/p&gt;\') ?&gt;</code>, which will output the link wrapped in its own paragraph. Just change the opening and closing tags in the function to make it output how you want. Dead simple!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That&#8217;s all for now&#8230; I hope it helps!</p>\n<p>Do you have a question about WordPress? Want to see it answered here on Weblog Tools Collection?

It can be anything WordPress-related, but here&#8217;s an exercise to focus your thinking.</p>\n<p>Think of questions like: What do I wish someone had told me when I started using WordPress?

I hope you were able to watch itâ€”there were some great sessions included and we&#8217;re hoping to have them available on WordPress.tv soon.</p>\n<p>The WordCamp video from was WordCamp Netherlands: <a href=\"http://www.successful-blog.com/\">Liz Strauss</a>&#8217;s presentation entitled &#8220;<a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2009/10/31/liz-strauss-identity-netherlands09/\">Meeting Your Audience Where They Are</a>.&#8221; If you&#8217;re interested in community-building or in building a personal brand, it&#8217;s definitely worth a look.</p>\n<p>On the tutorial side, we published a run-through by <a href=\"http://idratherbewriting.com/\">Tom Johnson</a> on <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2009/11/12/installing-wordpress-locally-using-wampserver/\">running a local copy of WordPress using WampServer</a>. Local copies can have tremendous development potential; if you regularly develop themes or plugins, or just like to tinker with WordPress, local installation can be a great help.</p>\n<p><strong>So here&#8217;s the special request:</strong> I&#8217;d like you to take a moment and think up one thingâ€”<em>just one thing</em>â€”you&#8217;d like to see covered in a video tutorial here at WordPress.tv. It can be anything WordPress-related, but here&#8217;s an exercise to focus your thinking.</p>\n<p>Think of questions like: What do I wish someone had told me when I started using WordPress? What kinds of things seem hard at first but really aren&#8217;t once you get down to it? What feature of WordPress do I wish more people knew about and used? What&#8217;s the feature, plugin, or whatever that gives me an awesome productivity boost or makes me a better WordPress user?</p>\n<p>Come up with one thing you&#8217;d like to see covered in a future video tutorial, and then <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/contact\">send us an email using our handy contact form</a>.

I am now moving again, to a service called prgmr.com.

With <a href=\"http://prgmr.com/xen/\">prgmr.com</a>, it&#8217;s even more no-frills, because the console isn&#8217;t web-based. It&#8217;s SSH all the way, baby. It&#8217;s not for everybody, but it suits me fine. And even though I have more servers, it reduces my monthly hosting costs by about 40%. That said, I&#8217;m also reducing my virtual <acronym title=\"Central Processing Unit\"><span class=\"caps\">CPU</span></acronym> power and disk space a little bit, and Slicehost has multiple facility locations, which might be factors for someone else shopping for hosting.

I&#8217;ve used <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/\">WP Super Cache</a> and <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/\">W3 Total Cache</a>. I&#8217;ve used <a href=\"http://xcache.lighttpd.net/\">XCache</a> for <acronym title=\"Php Hypertext Processor\"><span class=\"caps\">PHP</span></acronym> code caching, and for my <a href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2008/08/29/xcache-object-cache-plugin-for-wordpress-25\">WordPress object cache</a>. I&#8217;ve configured Apache to set caching headers for static files using <a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_expires.html\">mod_expires</a> to reduce requests. But I still get load and memory spikes that grind my server into dust. That shouldn&#8217;t happen with only 200 visitors per hour (granted, a page view can generate about 50 HTTP requests). Obviously, I&#8217;ve configured my server poorly.</p>\n<p>Like many large <a href=\"http://php.net/\"><acronym title=\"Php Hypertext Processor\"><span class=\"caps\">PHP</span></acronym></a> applications, <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a> can be a bit hungry for memory. So when it fights against <a href=\"http://mysql.com/\">MySQL</a> and an in-memory object cache for resources, things can start to get dicey. And of course, I&#8217;ve got a few other things on the server. When I get hit by a traffic spike (popular article, spammer runs, errant search spiders, etc), memory goes away fast. The machine starts to swap, things get slow, load average spikes as processes begin to wait for resources, and it all snowballs.

It looked beautiful, but so was <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/395419/voodoos-envy-133-is-thinnest-notebook-alive-based-on-intel-metro-concept-laptop\">the Envy 133</a> and the Envy was a complete waste of time and money due to a really bad trackpad and performance. Anyway, I&#8217;ve been playing with the X1 for 5-6 hours now, and here are some unordered thoughts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is the sexiest and most elegant laptop I&#8217;ve held or seen. Feels like it&#8217;s from the future.</li>\n<li>It feels almost too light, I actually threw it up and caught it, particularly with the normal-sized battery.</li>\n<li>I got the champagne color, which was a good choice.</li>\n<li>The ethernet port works in a really interesting way.</li>\n<li>Speed of browsing, installing, everything feels pretty good with Windows 7, but it&#8217;s obvious the graphics card is pretty underpowered. The moment you turn transparency on or get a flash video on Blip going it starts to stutter a bit.</li>\n<li>That said, I could imagine using this as my primary machine for short and medium trips.</li>\n<li>The keyboard takes a bit of getting used to in a way I haven&#8217;t run into before: the space bar is hard to hit. The keyboard is very compressed in vertical space so your thumb falls below where the space bar is, and you have to retrain your hand to be in a different position which isn&#8217;t as comfortable. The shift button can be hard to hit but that&#8217;s much easier to get used to, I&#8217;ve done it on other small keyboards. I&#8217;m not sure why they made it so small, it feels like it could stretch out a bit more.</li>\n<li>Other big annoyance is the trackpad &#8212; it&#8217;s really narrow. Windows machines do the trackpad scroll on the right and bottom edges of the pad and I find myself triggering that accidentally because the tracking area is so tiny. Again, lots of apparent space toward the bottom of the laptop just a really narrow tracking area. This is easier to get used to than the keyboard, though, and the trackpad feels nice like most Vaios and unlike the Voodoo Envy.</li>\n<li>I love that it has two USB ports, and a regular VGA connector instead of some weird micro-display-port you need a dongle for. (An Apple decision that bugs me almost as much as the recessed headphone connector on the original iPhone.)</li>\n<li>Screen is gorgeous, like all recent Vaios.</li>\n<li>Did I mention it&#8217;s drop-dead gorgeous? It&#8217;s the first laptop I&#8217;ve had in 5 years that I don&#8217;t want to put stickers on.</li>\n<li>Hardware-wise, way better than the Air.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So while it won&#8217;t be replacing my Z890 as primary workhorse for now, the X is so light I might take it on my next few trips and use it as a day-top. I&#8217;m especially excited by the prospect of the 14 hour battery life (probably 10 in real life use) giving me freedom from power cords through even a whole day at a WordCamp. We&#8217;ll see in a week or two if I&#8217;m able to comfortably adjust to the too-small keyboard and trackpad.</p>\";s:7:\"pubdate\";s:31:\"Wed, 11 Nov 2009 08:16:55 +0000\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:4:\"Matt\";}s:7:\"summary\";s:3605:\"<p><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-15095\" title=\"173338-sony_vaio_x_original\" src=\"http://s.ma.tt/files/2009/11/173338-sony_vaio_x_original-350x421.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"210\" height=\"253\" />I&#8217;m a little addicted to gadgets, especially Sony laptops which have served as my primary on-the-go machines for the past few years because of their power and portability. <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2009/09/02/sony-announces-vaio-x-ultraportable/\">When I first saw the Vaio X</a>, Sony&#8217;s new ultra-thin and ultra-light laptop, I was taken aback. It looked beautiful, but so was <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/395419/voodoos-envy-133-is-thinnest-notebook-alive-based-on-intel-metro-concept-laptop\">the Envy 133</a> and the Envy was a complete waste of time and money due to a really bad trackpad and performance. Anyway, I&#8217;ve been playing with the X1 for 5-6 hours now, and here are some unordered thoughts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is the sexiest and most elegant laptop I&#8217;ve held or seen. Feels like it&#8217;s from the future.</li>\n<li>It feels almost too light, I actually threw it up and caught it, particularly with the normal-sized battery.</li>\n<li>I got the champagne color, which was a good choice.</li>\n<li>The ethernet port works in a really interesting way.</li>\n<li>Speed of browsing, installing, everything feels pretty good with Windows 7, but it&#8217;s obvious the graphics card is pretty underpowered. The moment you turn transparency on or get a flash video on Blip going it starts to stutter a bit.</li>\n<li>That said, I could imagine using this as my primary machine for short and medium trips.</li>\n<li>The keyboard takes a bit of getting used to in a way I haven&#8217;t run into before: the space bar is hard to hit. The keyboard is very compressed in vertical space so your thumb falls below where the space bar is, and you have to retrain your hand to be in a different position which isn&#8217;t as comfortable. The shift button can be hard to hit but that&#8217;s much easier to get used to, I&#8217;ve done it on other small keyboards. I&#8217;m not sure why they made it so small, it feels like it could stretch out a bit more.</li>\n<li>Other big annoyance is the trackpad &#8212; it&#8217;s really narrow. Windows machines do the trackpad scroll on the right and bottom edges of the pad and I find myself triggering that accidentally because the tracking area is so tiny. Again, lots of apparent space toward the bottom of the laptop just a really narrow tracking area. This is easier to get used to than the keyboard, though, and the trackpad feels nice like most Vaios and unlike the Voodoo Envy.</li>\n<li>I love that it has two USB ports, and a regular VGA connector instead of some weird micro-display-port you need a dongle for. (An Apple decision that bugs me almost as much as the recessed headphone connector on the original iPhone.)</li>\n<li>Screen is gorgeous, like all recent Vaios.</li>\n<li>Did I mention it&#8217;s drop-dead gorgeous? It&#8217;s the first laptop I&#8217;ve had in 5 years that I don&#8217;t want to put stickers on.</li>\n<li>Hardware-wise, way better than the Air.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So while it won&#8217;t be replacing my Z890 as primary workhorse for now, the X is so light I might take it on my next few trips and use it as a day-top. I&#8217;m especially excited by the prospect of the 14 hour battery life (probably 10 in real life use) giving me freedom from power cords through even a whole day at a WordCamp. We&#8217;ll see in a week or two if I&#8217;m able to comfortably adjust to the too-small keyboard and trackpad.</p>\";}i:49;a:7:{s:5:\"title\";s:63:\"WordPress.tv: Liz Strauss: Meeting Your Audience

The effort required to keep this page up to date finally pushed me over the edge, and I installed Movable Type so I could just blog current events in my life. This article represents a snapshot of my interests, circa 26 February, 2003. For a more up-to-date view of my current interests, just take a look at my entries on the <a href=\"http://tribble.dreamhost.com\" title=\"Tribblescape : Home\">home page</a>.\n\nI play a number of different roleplaying and strategy games. The best roleplaying system I\'ve had the pleasure of playing is <em><a href=\"http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/\">GURPS</a></em>, the <em>Generic Universal RolePlaying System</em> from <a href=\"http://www.sjgames.com\">Steve Jackson Games</a>. <em>GURPS</em> provides enough detail to keep the most slavering game fanatic interested, yet it is simple enough that people completely new to roleplaying games can pick up the basics of the system in a short period of time. Check out <em><a href=\"http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/lite/\">GURPS Lite</a></em>, a 32-page distillation of the core rules, for a great introduction to this game and roleplaying in general.\n\nOther roleplaying games in which I have an interest include <em><a href=\"http://www.sjgames.com/in-nomine/\">In Nomine</a></em>, <em><a href=\"http://www.white-wolf.com/Games/Pages/MageHome.html\">Mage: the Ascension</a></em> (<a href=\"http://www.white-wolf.com\">White Wolf Games</a>), <em><a href=\"http://www.fasa.com/Shadowrun/SRHOME.html\">Shadowrun</a></em> (<a href=\"http://www.fasa.com\">Fasa</a>), <em><a href=\"http://www.best.com/~rtg1/cp2020.html\">Cyberpunk 2020</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://www.best.com/~rtg1/mekton.html\">Mekton Z</a></em> (<a href=\"http://www.best.com/~rtg1/\">R. Talsorian</a>), and <em><a href=\"http://www.imperiumgames.com\">Traveller</a></em> (<a href=\"http://www.imperiumgames.com\">Imperium Games</a>, recently re-released as <em><a href=\"http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Traveller/\">GURPS Traveller</a></em>). I\'ve also put together a Web tool for generating Vilani names for <em>Traveller</em>; take a look at my <a href=\"vilani.php\"><em>Vilani by Lonnie</em></a> page.\n\nAlong with roleplaying, I also enjoy strategic, tactical, and miniatures gaming. My favorite system by far is <em><a href=\"http://www.fullthrust.net/\">Full Thrust</a></em>. Made by <a href=\"http://www.gzg.com\">Ground Zero Games</a> in England, <em>Full Thrust</em> is a miniature space fleet game with very quick and simple rules.\n\nAt one time or another, I\'ve also played <em><a href=\"http://www.sjgames.com/car-wars/\">Car Wars</a></em>, <em><a href=\"http://www.sjgames.com/ogre/\">Ogre</a></em>, <em><a href=\"http://www.dp9.com/tour/HG.htm\">Heavy Gear</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"http://www.wizards.com/RoboRally/Welcome.html\">Robo Rally</a></em>.\n\nI\'ve been playing a number of amusing games from <a href=\"http://www.cheapass.com\">Cheapass Games</a>, a company dedicated to offering very fun and ludicrously inexpensive games. All three of the games I\'ve played so far (<em><a href=\"http://www.cheapass.com/falling2.html\">Falling</a></em>, <em><a href=\"http://www.cheapass.com/drlucky.html\">Kill Doctor Lucky</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"http://www.cheapass.com/brain.html\">Give Me the Brain</a></em>) are hilarious and a heckuva lot of fun to play, particularly at parties. And for the price, you just can\'t beat these games.\n\nAnd yes, I have been known to play <em><a href=\"http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Welcome.html\">Magic: the Gathering</a></em>, though I try to give <a href=\"http://www.wizards.com\">Wizards of the Coast</a> as little money as possible; no self-respecting gamer wants to appear to be supporting an Evil Empire, especially one that unleashed the <em>Pokemon</em> card game on an unsuspecting public.\n\n','Gaming snapshot',0,'\n','publish','open','open','','gaming-snapshot','','','2003-02-26 00:00:00','2003-02-26 07:00:00','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/?p=3',0,'post','',0),(2,1,'2008-04-01 18:28:18','2008-04-02 01:28:18','nyerm is Lonnon Foster\'s little corner of the web.

This tiny computer keeps track of my schedule and to do list, holds all sorts of useful information that I need to refer to when I\'m away from my desktop machine, keeps me from getting bored during bus rides with a variety of games and reading material, and insures that amongst my friends, I am <em>the</em> source for phone numbers. It\'s also got a built-in camera (capable of capturing still images and video), a voice recorder, and an MP3 player. I expect that with the right attachments, it would also make a decent cup of coffee.\n\nNot content merely to own and use a handheld, I also write software for the <a href=\"http://www.palmsource.com/palmos\">Palm OS</a>. Take a look at the <a href=\"http://tribble.dreamhost.com/palm.php\" title=\"Tribblescape Palm Zone\">Tribblescape Palm Zone</a> to see a few of my programming efforts that managed to escape the lab to wreak havoc on the Web.\n\nNot content merely to write software for the Palm OS, I also wrote a book on the subject: <a href=\"http://www.palmosbible.com\"><em>Palm OS Programming Bible</em></a>. I could go into excruciating detail about how large and wonderful the book is, but its Web site already contains all the marketing material you could ever want to read (and then some), so I urge you to take a look there if you\'re at all interested in Palm OS programming.\n\nMy favorite sites for Palm OS information are <a href=\"http://www.clieuk.co.uk/index.shtml\">Cli&eacute;Planet</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cliesource.com\">Cli&eacute;Source</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.palminfocenter.com\">Palm Infocenter</a>.

It is a powerful tool that helps to organize and accomplish tasks only dreamed of by earlier generations of humanity. But more importantly: you can play games on one.\n\nMy most recent waste of time on a PC is <a href=\"http://www.earthandbeyond.com\"><em>Earth & Beyond</em></a>, a fantastic MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game) that puts you in the shoes of a starship captain, along with thousands of other players, in real time. <em>Earth & Beyond</em> does a good job of catering to different play styles; it\'s possible to advance in the game through combat, trade, and exploration. It also gets away from the tired clich&eacute;s of fantasy RPGs; <em>Earth & Beyond</em> is a refreshing alternative to bashing orcs.\n\nI\'m also a fan of first-person shooters. My most recent addiction is <a href=\"http://www.dayofdefeatmod.com\"><em>Day of Defeat</em></a>, a World War II modification to <a href=\"http://www.half-life.com\"><em>Half-Life</em></a>. You can play on the Allied or Axis sides, with very nicely researched and modeled weaponry for either. Game play requires much tactical thinking; running in guns blazing is usually a quick way to die.\n\nWhen I get a new computer put together that can handle the strain of a modern 3D game engine, I plan to spend a lot of time playing <a href=\"http://www.neverwinternights.com\"><em>Neverwinter Nights</em></a>, a really nice adaptation of the <a href=\"http://www.wizards.com/dnd\"><em>Dungeons & Dragons, 3rd Edition</em></a> rules. The graphics are truly outstanding, but they\'re a slideshow on my poor little 450MHz Celeron and Nvidia TNT2 rig.\n\nI picked up an <a href=\"http://www.xbox.com\">Xbox</a> last year, and my housemate owns a <a href=\"http://www.playstation.com\">Playstation 2</a>, so I\'ve developed an unhealthy attachment to console gaming. I just finished <a href=\"http://www.splintercell.com\"><em>Splinter Cell</em></a>, a fabulous romp through the near future of NSA spookdom. I\'m currently playing <a href=\"http://www.rockstargames.com/vicecity/\"><em>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.ratchetandclank.com\"><em>Ratchet & Clank</em></a>, and <a href=\"http://www.ea.com/eagames/official/lordoftherings/home.jsp\"><em>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</em></a> on the PS2. I will always be a <a href=\"http://www.bungie.net/halo\"><em>Halo</em></a> fan; it stands as the best game ever made for the Xbox. Hopefully, lightning can strike twice, and the upcoming <a href=\"http://www.bungie.net/halo2\"><em>Halo 2</em></a> will be able to live up to the hype of its predecessor.\n','Computer Gaming snapshot',0,'\n','publish','open','open','','computer-gaming-snapshot','','','2003-02-26 00:00:00','2003-02-26 07:00:00','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/?p=5',0,'post','',2),(6,2,'2003-02-26 00:00:00','2003-02-26 07:00:00','<strong>Note:</strong> This article is a snapshot of content from my old <a href=\"http://tribble.dreamhost.com/interests.php\" title=\"Tribblescape : Interests\">Interests</a> page.

For a more up-to-date view of my current interests, just take a look at my entries on the <a href=\"http://tribble.dreamhost.com\" title=\"Tribblescape : Home\">home page</a>.\n\nEver since acquiring a <a href=\"http://www.tivo.com\">TiVo</a>, I\'ve watched more television than I used to, because I\'m usually guaranteed to have something on that\'s worth watching. Shows I\'m currently enjoying include <a href=\"http://www.westwingtv.com\"><em>The West Wing</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi/\"><em>CSI</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi_miami/\"><em>CSI Miami</em></a>, and the lovely British import, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/crime/waking/\"><em>Waking the Dead</em></a>. Yes, there\'s a definite forensic theme to a lot of the TV I\'m watching; it appeals to my inner geek.\n\nI\'m also faithfully watching <a href=\"http://www.startrek.com/launch/default.asp\"><em>Enterprise</em></a>, which is a refreshing return to a Star Trek property that doesn\'t completely suck (like, say, <em>Voyager</em>). I\'m still a big <a href=\"http://www.farscape.com\"><em>FarScape</em></a> fan, but I\'ve been holding off watching the few episodes I\'ve got on the TiVo, because they may well be the last episodes that will be produced due to really dumb decisions by the executives at the <a href=\"http://www.scifi.com\">Sci Fi Channel</a>. With any luck, the <a href=\"http://www.henson.com\">Jim Henson Company</a> will find someone else to syndicate the show, because something this good deserves to remain on the air.\n\nAlso, my favorite British sitcom is back for a new season; <em><a href=\"http://www.phill.co.uk/comedy/astime/index.html\">As Time Goes By</a></em> is a charming show starring Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer. It\'s nice for a change to see a sitcom with good acting and characters I wouldn\'t mind meeting in real life.\n\nMusically, my tastes are extremely eclectic.  My current obsession is <a href=\"http://www.garbage.com\">Garbage</a>.  Other favorites include <a href=\"http://www.stabbingwestward.com\">Stabbing Westward</a>, <a href=\"http://www.badreligion.com\">Bad Religion</a>, <a href=\"http://syrinx.umd.edu/rush.html\">Rush</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tempestmusic.com\">Tempest</a>, <a href=\"http://www.j-tull.com/\">Jethro Tull</a>, <a href=\"http://www.paperboys.com\">The Paperboys</a>, <a href=\"http://www.captaintractor.com\">Captain Tractor</a>, <a href=\"http://wolf359.com/radio_iodine/\">Radio Iodine</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.quinlanroad.com/\">Loreena McKennitt</a>.\n\nI\'m a fan of MP3 audio.  Yeah, I\'ve played around with <a href=\"http://www.winamp.com\">WinAmp</a> before and I figured, \"Cool, another web audio format; at least they got the compression right this time.\"  Well, several months after I learned about it, MP3 became the biggest online political issue since the CDA, and folks released hardware MP3 players so you don\'t have to sit at your desk to listen to it any more.  With a good CD ripper, I can drag a whole bunch of stuff with me to work via Zip disk and set it on shuffle, never having to even swap discs during the day.  Too cool.\n\nThe other fun bit with MP3s is that besides freaking out the Recording Industry Association of America over copyright issues, it provides independent artists with a way to publish music cheaply, straight to the net.  This also pisses off the RIAA, since they don\'t get their cut.  Gotta love it.  Places like <a href=\"http://www.kosmic.org\">the Kosmic Free Music Foundation</a> have a lot of interesting stuff (particularly if you\'re into electronic music) that is very simple to get a hold of in MP3 format.\n\nI read science fiction and fantasy; among my favorite authors are <a href=\"http://lonestar.texas.net/~dub/bsinfo.html\">Bruce Sterling</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sff.net/people/Vonda\">Vonda N. McIntyre</a>, <a href=\"http://www.kithrup.com/brin/\">David Brin</a>, <a href=\"http://www.levity.com/corduroy/leguin.htm\">Ursula K. LeGuin</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wolfstar.com/~gothmog/BookCenter/TolkienRes.shtml\">J. R. R.

I also read comic books (gasp!).  Favorite authors include <a href=\"http://www.holycow.com/dreaming/\">Neil Gaiman</a> (<em>Sandman</em>), Alan Moore (<em>V for Vendetta</em>, <em>Watchmen</em>, <em>From Hell</em>, <em>League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</em>), Masamune Shirow (<em>Appleseed</em>, <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>), Ben Edlund (<em>The Tick</em>), <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/4271/sakai.html\">Stan Sakai</a> (<em>Usagi Yojimbo</em>), Brian Michael Bendis (<em>Powers</em>), and <a href=\"http://www.nausicaa.net/~miyazaki/\">Hayao Miyazaki</a> (<em>Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind</em>, <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em>).\n\n','Passive Entertainment snapshot',0,'\n','publish','open','open','','passive-entertainment-snapshot','','','2003-02-26 00:00:00','2003-02-26 07:00:00','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/?p=6',0,'post','',0),(7,2,'2003-02-27 02:37:44','2003-02-27 09:37:44','This is my first posting to the new blog.

It\'s in extremely poor taste, <em>dangerous</em> even, to wave an object of addiction under the nose of a former junkie.\r\n\r\nThe really bad thing about getting mail like this is that I\'m not really a <em>recovered</em> MMORPG addict, just a <em>different</em> one. I only managed to kick my EQ habit by replacing it with AO, and the only reason I no longer play AO is that I\'ve turned my online gaming yen toward <a href=\"http://www.earthandbeyond.com\">Earth &amp; Beyond</a>. I\'ve promised myself only one online addiction at a time, which means that I actually get to <em>sleep</em> every once in a while. I must admit to being sorely tempted to indulge in another 30 days of EQ or AO, \"risk-free\" with \"no obligation\".\r\n\r\nI really enjoy being married, though.\r\n\r\nThe email campaign by these two games reminds me a lot of the \"we were bad, we\'re sorry, please join us again\" snail mail that I still get from Columbia House Records, but with a sinister edge to it.

In the last couple of weeks, I\'ve discovered enough ways to waste time online to keep me unproductive well into the next decade.\r\n\r\nI\'ve been trying to find a good way to keep my Web browsing time to a minimum, but still satisfy my information addiction. Aside from using \"blogrolling.com\":http://www.blogrolling.com (which I discovered yesterday) to keep track of when favorite blogs have been updated, I\'ve been reading up on <a href=\"http://backend.userland.com/rss\"><acronym title=\"Really Simple Syndication\">RSS</acronym></a> syndication and news aggregators. I\'ve got a bunch of them lined up to try now:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://bitworking.org/Aggie.html\">Aggie</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.headlineviewer.com/\">Headline Viewer</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://radio.userland.com/\">Radio Userland</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.feedreader.com/\">FeedReader</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/\">AmphetaDesk</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li> <a href=\"http://www.newzcrawler.com/\">NewzCrawler</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI feel like I\'ve been living in a cave, or maybe just the early 90s. Combined with some of the reading I\'ve been doing lately (Cory Doctorow\'s <a href=\"http://www.craphound.com/down/\"><em>Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.sjgames.com/transhuman/core/\"><em>GURPS Transhuman Space</em></a>), this kind of automated information-gathering technology seems essential to the advancement of humankind\'s potential. All we need now are pocket AIs and augmented reality implants.\r\n\r\n<strong>Update:</strong> Aggregators are definitely not a mature technology yet; most of the programs listed above (at least the free ones) are somewhat shaky in the user interface department. The idea has promise, though. For the time being, my favorite is AmphetaDesk, which does a decent job of grabbing my daily news for me. I\'ve put a link to AmphetaDesk in my Windows Startup folder, and from there, it\'s set up to refresh from my favorite sites every three hours. It\'s not perfect â€” my biggest complaint is trying to navigate through the single HTML page it generates for all of the sites it scrapes â€” but it\'s more convenient than manually clicking through a pageful of links, which was my old aggregation method.','Aggregating aggregators',0,'','publish','open','open','','aggregating-aggregators','','','2008-04-01 21:22:36','2008-04-02 04:22:36','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/?p=20',0,'post','',0),(21,2,'2003-03-06 19:12:18','2003-03-07 02:12:18','<a title=\"Nouveau Niche\" href=\"http://www.thestandard.com/article/display/0,1151,19498,00.html\">Nouveau Niche</a> is an interesting profile on Cory Doctorow and his <a href=\"http://www.opencola.com\">Opencola</a> project.

The Internet isn\'t difficult to understand, unless you have the restrictive preconceived notions of government, business, or religion to contend with.\r\n\r\nI\'m particularly fond of this passage:\r\n<blockquote>... the Internet feels to so many of us like a natural resource. We have flocked to it as if it were a part of human nature just waiting to happen ï¿½ just as speaking and writing now feel like a part of what it means to be human.</blockquote>\r\nGive it a read.

I run at 1024 x 768 resolution, and with all the features turned on for a bookmarklet (TrackBack items, Category, Allow Comments, the works), the height of the window comes out to 880, considerably taller than my screen.\n\nThe problem with having a window this tall is that it makes it hard to get to the Post and Cancel buttons at the bottom of the window. All of the text fits within the window, so there is no scroll bar supplied by the browser (I\'m using IE, but I suspect this happens in other browsers, too). However, not all of the window fits on my screen, so the bottom part of the form is hidden from view. I have to resize or maximize the window before I get a scroll bar, and only then can I get to the buttons at the bottom of the form.\n\nFortunately, it\'s a fairly easy fix. I modified the <code>_bm_js</code> function in lib/MT/App/CMS.pm to generate better JavaScript that takes the actual height of the display into account when setting the window\'s height. Here is the altered function:\n\n==\n<textarea rows=\"10\" cols=\"50\" style=\"font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: x-small\">\nsub _bm_js {\nmy($uri, $show, $height) = @_;\nqq!javascript:d=document;t=d.selection?d.selection.createRange().text:d.getSelection();void(window.open(\'$uri?is_bm=1&amp;bm_show=$show&amp;__mode=view&amp;_type=entry&amp;link_title=\'+escape(d.title)+\'&amp;link_href=\'+escape(d.location.href)+\'&amp;text=\'+escape(t),\'_blank\',\'scrollbars=yes,width=400,height=(($height > screen.height) ? screen.height : $height),status=yes,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes\'))!;\n}\n</textarea>\n==\n\nThe only change here is in the <code>height=</code> part of the JavaScript line. Instead of the original\n\n<blockquote><code>height=</code></blockquote>\n\nI\'ve used the following conditional statement\n\n<blockquote><code>height==(($height > screen.height) ? screen.height : $height)</code></blockquote>\n\nIn English, if the height of the window, as calculated by the make_bm_link function in CMS.pm, is greater than the actual height of the screen, set the window to the screen height. Otherwise, use the calculated height.\n\nThis fix makes the popup window work better for people who use lower screen resolutions. More importantly, it doesn\'t annoy the crap out of me any more.\n','MT bookmarklet window hack',0,'\n','publish','open','open','','mt-bookmarklet-window-hack','','','2003-03-07 14:56:02','2003-03-07 21:56:02','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/?p=24',0,'post','',2),(25,2,'2003-03-07 15:54:48','2003-03-07 22:54:48','A Friday quote from one of my favorite ancient texts, the <a title=\"HÃ¡vamÃ¡l\" href=\"http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/havamal.html\">HÃ¡vamÃ¡l</a>:\r\n<blockquote>Young was I once, I walked alone,\r\nand bewildered seemed in the way;\r\nthen I found me another and rich I thought me,\r\nfor man is the joy of man.</blockquote>','Random Norse wisdom department',0,'','publish','open','open','','random-norse-wisdom-department','','','2008-04-01 21:15:29','2008-04-02 04:15:29','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/?p=25',0,'post','',0),(26,2,'2003-03-08 00:47:35','2003-03-08 07:47:35','<a href=\"http://tribble.dreamhost.com/images/garden_city.html\" onclick=\"window.open(\'http://tribble.dreamhost.com/images/garden_city.html\',\'popup\',\'width=480,height=640,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0\'); return false\"><img class=\"thumb\" src=\"http://tribble.dreamhost.com/images/garden_city-thumb.jpg\" width=\"75\" height=\"100\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></a>My wife and I went to Portland, Oregon a couple weekends ago, and while we were there, we visited the <a href=\"http://www.portlandchinesegarden.org/\">Portland Classical Chinese Garden</a>.

One of the most interesting bits from the article is what happened when InFlow\'s author, Valdis Krebs, used the program to map political groups based on book purchases at Amazon.com:\n\n<blockquote>\"What I got were two cliques that were about as distinct as they could be. I kept looking for paths that crossed between them. Every time I tried to follow one of these paths, I\'d go out three or four steps, and then boom, I\'m right back in the clique.\" Most strikingly, the two networks intersected only on a single title: Bernard Lewis\'s <em>What Went Wrong</em>. Otherwise, the two groups were engrossed in entirely different reading lists, with no common ground.</blockquote>\n\nWhile not rigorously scientific, this little experiment in political social mapping points out one of the biggest problems in American democracy today: lack of discourse. The left and the right aren\'t listening to each other. Liberals get more liberal, and conservatives get more conservative, each side isolating itself from the influence of the other.\n\nThe real power and promise of democracy occurs only when parties that disagree engage in dialog with each other. It\'s okay if two sides disagree, as long as they\'re willing to actually listen to the other side\'s point of view. Often, when two parties take the time to really listen to each other\'s beliefs, they realize that they actually agree on many important issues. These agreements, and the compromises that result from them, are the foundation for positive change in society.\n','Social mapping and politics',0,'\n','publish','open','open','','social-mapping-and-politics','','','2003-03-12 10:53:42','2003-03-12 17:53:42','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/?p=29',0,'post','',0),(30,2,'2003-03-14 11:54:50','2003-03-14 18:54:50','I wish I\'d seen this a few weeks ago when I first started this blog.

MT does a great job of making this really simple on a desktop machine; I can spew forth content at rates I only dreamt of when I was hand-coding individual .html files. However, I want to be able to post useless information to my blog <em>everywhere I go</em>.\r\n\r\nEnter my other obsession (besides blogging): Palm OS handhelds. I\'m currently using a Sony CLIÃ‰ NX70V, which has a couple of good options for hooking up to the Internet:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a title=\"PEG-NX Series Accessories\" href=\"http://sonyelectronics.sonystyle.com/micros/clie/accessories/accessory-NX.html\">Sony Wireless LAN Card</a>. The NX has a Compact Flash slot on the back, into which I can slot this 802.11b wireless card. At the expense of some extra battery drain while it\'s operating, I could surf the Web and post to Tribblescape from the comfort of my local coffee shop. Or from the bathroom at work, if I\'m so inclined. With more and more public WiFi access points coming online (even <a title=\"McDonald\'s, Intel put WiFi access on the menu\" href=\"http://www.commsdesign.com/story/OEG20030311S0030\">McDonald\'s</a> is jumping on the bandwagon), this little piece of hardware could become very useful.</li>\r\n	<li><a title=\"Sony Clie Bluetooth Memory Stick\" href=\"http://www.expansys.us/product.asp?code=PEGA-MSB1\">Sony CLIÃ‰ Bluetooth Memory Stick</a>. This is my favorite option. I\'ve already got a <a title=\"Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications\" href=\"http://www.sonyericsson.com/us/spg.jsp?page=start\">Sony Ericsson T68i</a> phone, which has both Bluetooth and <acronym title=\"General Packet Radio Service\">GPRS</acronym> capabilities. The Bluetooth card extends my blogging ability to any place my phone works, which currently covers most of the urban northwestern United States (for no more than I\'m already spending to support my <a title=\"AT&amp;T Wireless\" href=\"http://www.mlife.com\">\"mLife\"</a>), all of urban North America (for somewhat more expensive roaming charges), and even urban areas all over the planet (for hideously expensive international rates and the trouble of calling AT&amp;T in advance to activate the service overseas). I could rack up an amazing phone bill in very little time, indeed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nRegardless of which piece of wireless tech I install, I\'m curious how well the various browsers available for the NX can handle form input. I\'m already used to the idea that the tiny screen on my handheld won\'t be able to do every Web page justice (although at 320 Ã— 480 resolution, some browsers can do an outstanding job of rendering a page very close to its original form), but I have no idea what the browsers are capable of regarding HTML forms support.\r\n\r\nLooks like I\'ll have to hit the forums at <a title=\"CliePlanet\" href=\"http://www.clieuk.co.uk/index.shtml\">CliePlanet</a> and <a title=\"ClieSource\" href=\"http://www.cliesource.com\">ClieSource</a> to do a little research.

I honestly believe that it is our duty as one of the most powerful economic, diplomatic, and military forces on the planet to end suffering, whether it occurs within our borders or without. Economic and diplomatic means have clearly failed to cause positive change in Iraq. Sanctions have brought only suffering and resentment of the US to most of the Iraqi people. Saddam Hussein and his government have abused diplomatic efforts in an effort to hold power and buy more time in which to strengthen their death grip on their nation.\r\n\r\nSaddam Hussein is a power-mad dictator, and no amount of asking him nicely is going to make him release his hold on Iraq. It is a necessary obligation of those powers who claim to support a just and equal society to remove him from power. After more than a decade of failed diplomacy, it\'s time for the United States, as the standard bearer of democracy in the world, to force the government of Iraq out of power.\r\n\r\nBut that doesn\'t mean we have to be assholes about it.\r\n\r\nThe Bush administration\'s complete lack of tact has undermined any legitimacy a war on Iraq might have had. Bush and his cabinet display a stunning ignorance of international diplomatic etiquette. I appreciate that many of our nation\'s policy makers feel they have a no-bullshit approach to diplomacy, shooting straight from the hip and telling it like it is without couching foreign policy in a lot of flowery language. Straight talking is an admirable goal, but successful foreign relations require a minimum level of decorum that is absent from this administration\'s communication with foreign governments.\r\n\r\nAs a nation, we cannot afford a lapse in manners. By necessity, diplomacy entails telling other nations things they don\'t want to hear, and those distasteful things must be said carefully. Failure to treat other nations with dignity, as equals in a global community, weakens the United States, and it weakens the cause of democracy worldwide. If we are to expect other nations to treat their own people with respect, we must first treat other nations with respect. Alienating other nations is dangerous in an age when we depend on a global marketplace for our goods, and our enemies can strike at us on our own soil.\r\n\r\nThe most embarassing thing for Bush and his staff is that they\'ve lost a popularity contest to a brutal, petty tyrant. The real failure of diplomacy was not between the United States and Iraq, but between the United States and the entire global community. It takes arrogance and no small amount of real stupidity to make the leader of the free world look like more of a thug than a man who callously murders his own people, and the Bush administration has managed to do just that.','Miss Manners, Bush needs a talking to',0,'','publish','open','open','','miss-manners-bush-needs-a-talking-to','','','2008-04-01 20:28:32','2008-04-02 03:28:32','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/?p=36',0,'post','',0),(37,2,'2003-03-18 11:47:33','2003-03-18 18:47:33','I finally managed to get Win32 Emacs 21.2.1 to properly handle a Unicode text file. I\'ve been meaning to get around to this for a while, because more and more often, the APIs in various Windows-based development platforms (among them Xbox) expect Unicode text files for configuration information. Even the Registry Editor (regedit) in Windows XP has jumped on the Unicode bandwagon, spewing forth Unicode text files when you export a registry entry.\r\n\r\nI really despise having to edit text files in either Notepad or Visual Studio, neither of which offer me the editing speed brought about by years of using Emacs, but until now, opening a Unicode text file in Emacs produced mostly illegible garbage. Every other character is a null, which displays as <code>^@</code> in Emacs. The string <code>foo</code>, for example, turns into <code>f^@o^@o^@</code>. You just can\'t edit that kind of garbage. Not safely, at any rate.\r\n\r\nFortunately, due largely to the efforts of Japanese programmers, the <a title=\"Mule-UCS Unofficial Site\" href=\"http://tats.iris.ne.jp/mule-ucs/\">Mule-UCS Emacs Lisp library</a> provides all the Unicode support I need. A little byte-compilation, a little file movement, and a little editing in my .emacs file, and Emacs is now a lean, mean, Unicode-editing machine.\r\n\r\nMy only complaint is that, even byte-compiled, it takes several seconds to load Mule-UCS when starting Emacs. Fortunately, it\'s not difficult to load up the module when I need it with the <code>eval-expression</code> function (by default, bound to <code>M-:</code>). Manually evaluating <code>(require \'un-define)</code> is much less painful than waiting for the same line to evaluate from my <code>.emacs</code> file every time Emacs starts.','Emacs Unicode support on Win32',0,'','publish','open','open','','emacs-unicode-support-on-win32','','','2008-04-01 20:28:24','2008-04-02 03:28:24','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/?p=37',0,'post','',1),(38,2,'2003-03-18 12:05:22','2003-03-18 19:05:22','A friend tossed me a link to some <a title=\"Phone Scoop : Frog Design / Motorola Offspring Wearables Concept\" href=\"http://www.phonescoop.com/articles/moto_wearables/\">wearable computing concept designs</a>.

It\'s understandable that they would prefer people to use Adobe Acrobat or InDesign for this purpose, and it may be argued that those are much better tools for the job. However, when the only tool you have is Illustrator, it\'s not nearly that simple.\r\n\r\nThis is a topic that\'s been covered \"elsewhere\":http://www.lifeclever.com/how-to-create-multi-page-pdfs-in-illustrator-cs2/, but never with all the pieces in one place where I can easily find them. Small wonder, then, that I\'ve only recently been able to get this working. These simple instructions work great for most Illustrator files, but I recently needed to make some brochures that have bleeds. With most printer drivers, Illustrator insists on trimming the edges of a multi-page PDF to fit within the printable area allowed by the printer. This isn\'t so hot when the margins include artwork that should become part of the finished PDF.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHere\'s how I\'ve made this all work.\r\n\r\nh3. Install Adobe generic PostScript driver\r\n\r\nUnless you\'ve already got a driver for a printer that prints all the way to the edges of the paper, you\'ll need a driver that does. This was my primary stumbling block; the Lexpro I normally print to at work is a pretty basic black and white laser printer, and it doesn\'t print to the edges.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Adobe has a generic PostScript Printer Description (PPD) file available for download.

A small remark in the report\'s <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/pgtrpt/2002/html/19987.htm\">Western Hemisphere Overview</a> brings up some concerns about Canadian policy being an impediment to terrorism investigation:\n\nbq. Some US law-enforcement officers have expressed concern that Canadian privacy laws, as well as funding levels for law enforcement, inhibit a fuller and more timely exchange of information and response to requests for assistance. Also, Canadian laws and regulations intended to protect Canadian citizens and landed immigrants from Government intrusion sometimes limit the depth of investigations.\n\nBecause of the bad light in which Jim Bronskill\'s article paints the report, I was originally going to rant about the Bush administration and its pattern of poor diplomacy and the executive branch\'s increasing desire to ignore Constitutional guarantees of civil liberties in its zeal to crack down on terrorists. While I still strongly believe both of these to be true, I\'d rather rant about Bronskill\'s explosion of a minor comment into some kind of mortal insult against Canada. I went to the State Department\'s Web site and looked up the report for myself.\n\nRe-read that one small excerpt from the report. Does that single paragraph, which is the only part of the report that criticizes Canada in any way, seem to warrant an article titled \"U.S. says Canada cares too much about liberties\"? The report says \"some US law-enforcement officers\" have concerns about Canada\'s laws being an impediment to investigation of potential terrorists. This hardly sounds like the opinion of the whole executive branch, much less the entire nation.\n\nNot only is this is one tiny paragraph a minor statement of concern, it\'s not even a very large statement in the context of the report. The section on Canada in the Western Hemisphere Overview devotes more than nine times more text to praising Canadian cooperation with US anti-terrorism efforts than it does to this one small paragraph.\n\nBronskill has excerpted only the miniscule parts of the report that paint an ugly picture of State Department policy. To his partial credit, he does briefly mention toward the end of his article that the report includes \"effusive praise for the federal government\'s overall efforts to work with the U.S. in the fight against extremism\". Given the ratio of praise to criticism in the report, Bronskill\'s focus on the negative is a pathetic attempt to twist the report into something far more sinister than it actually is.\n\nI\'ll be the first to argue that the United States government has been paranoid in the extreme since 9-11, and I fear the loss of liberties that kind of paranoia inspires. But we\'ve got enough real civil liberties problems to worry about (<a href=\"http://www.freemikehawash.org/\">Mike Hawash</a> being foremost in my mind) without seeing bogeymen in relatively innocuous comments from the State Department.\n','Canada cares too much about civil liberties?',0,'\n','publish','open','open','','canada-cares-too-much-about-civil-liberties','','','2003-05-05 11:05:42','2003-05-05 18:05:42','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/2003/05/05/canada-cares-too-much-about-civil-liberties/',0,'post','',0),(98,2,'2003-05-05 15:16:38','2003-05-05 22:16:38','Scared of the SARS epidemic?

Gabriel, my current machine, has served me well for entirely too many years. He\'s an Intel Celeron 300, overclocked to 450 MHz. A stellar machine for his time (more than five years ago, if I remember correctly), he\'s fallen a bit behind the curve. The most modern piece of Gabriel is the 512 MB of RAM he uses, and even that seems inadequate when combined with the slow processor and NVIDIA Riva TNT2. I played <a href=\"http://www.maxpayne.com/\">Max Payne</a> three times on Gabriel, but it was a progressively more painful experience each time, and not because I cranked up the difficulty level each time through.\n\nGabriel II, currently on order from <a href=\"http://newegg.com/\">Newegg.com</a>, will be a sleek little machine, with emphasis on little. I\'ve chosen to build him in a <a href=\"http://www.shuttle.com/new/product/barebone/specs_b.asp?B_id=7\">Shuttle SS51G</a> <acronym title=\"Small Form Factor\">SFF</acronym> case, so he\'ll be roughly a fifth the size of Gabriel, who occupies an ATX mid-tower case. I don\'t need space for a half dozen PCI peripherals when I\'ve got built-in USB 2.0, and a single 80 GB hard drive is perfectly fine for a general use machine that will see use in equal parts as a gaming platform, software development environment, artist\'s paintbox, and ridiculously over-powered Web browser. 2.53 GHz isn\'t the actual top end of PC processing power right now, but it\'s going to seem infinitely faster than my current machine, particularly when coupled with an <a href=\"http://mirror.ati.com/products/pc/aiw9700pro/index.html\">ATI All-In-Wonder Radeon 9700 Pro</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://tribble.dreamhost.com/archives/gabriel2_wishlist.html\">This Newegg wishlist</a> contains a complete rundown of what will go into Gabriel II, sans the legacy internal Zip 100 drive that I\'ll steal from Gabriel.

When I started seriously looking for parts for Gabriel II back in December 2002, this machine was more in the neighborhood of US$2500.

This post, however, deals with the drastic weakening of copyright protections by the proposed \"Orphan Works Act of 2008\":http://capwiz.com/illustratorspartnership/issues/bills/?billid=11320236 (H.R.5889). This piece of legislation would damage the livelihoods of living artists, amending the law to allow anyone to infringe on a visual work\'s copyright after being unable to locate its author after a \"reasonably diligent search.\" In theory, this would allow works whose authors have died or otherwise dropped off the face of the earth to be used commercially, which could only be a good thing, right?\r\n\r\nNot so much. The infringer would be allowed to determine what constitutes a \"reasonably diligent search.\" This goes far beyond fair use; the infringer would be free to commercially exploit the work for any purpose. The entire burden of proving copyright infringement of a so-called orphaned work would fall on the artist. Current copyright protections provide for injunctive relief, payment of attorney\'s fees, limitations of damages in a countersuit, and a discovery process for determining infringement; none of these would apply to orphaned works. Even images that directly incorporate copyright and contact information would be easy prey for unscrupulous infringers who deliberately remove such information, because they could claim an orphaned works defense, making it nearly impossible for an artist to prove infringement.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe bill proposes a poorly designed technological solution: databases of known works, in which artists would register their work so it would be available for searches and comparison. However, these databases would be run by for-profit companies, and with no limit on what could be charged per work, it would be prohibitively expensive for artists to register their work. Anything not located in these databases would instantly become orphaned works; a cursory glance at the databases would be all an infringer would need to claim a \"reasonably diligent search\" for a work\'s original artist.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, works created by artists outside the United States would be required to register, which violates both the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property, both of which prohibit the impediment to exercise of rights that a registration database would create.\r\n\r\nI first ran across this alarming bit of legislation on \"Brad Guigar\'s blog\":http://www.evil-comic.com/forums/stains/5278/ at his fine webcomic, \"Evil, Inc.\":http://www.evil-comic.com. He provides a link to a page where you can \"take action against the bill\":http://capwiz.com/illustratorspartnership/home/, which also includes a good \"overview of the bill\'s effects\":http://capwiz.com/illustratorspartnership/issues/bills/?billid=11320236.\r\n\r\nThe \"IPA(Illustrators\' Partnership of America)\":http://www.illustratorspartnership.org/ has been following this legislation from its inception earlier this year, and their \"Orphan Works Resource Page for Artists\":http://www.illustratorspartnership.org/01_topics/article.php?searchterm=00185 is an excellent source of further information. Included is a copy of a \"letter written by artist Michiko Stehrenberger\":http://www.illustratorspartnership.org/01_topics/article.php?searchterm=00235, whose work was stolen by a tobacco company and who wouldn\'t have had any legal recourse under the law proposed in H.R.5889. You can also read the <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.5889:\">actual text of the bill</a> on the Library of Congress site.\r\n\r\nI hope someday to make a living from my art, so seeing irresponsible legislation like this makes me extraordinarily angry.

It gives creators of online content an easy way to charge for online content and services.\n\nAren\'t there already hundreds of ways to charge for stuff online? Yes, and that\'s precisely the problem. Every site has its own way of charging, and it takes too long to sign up for subscriptions and payment systems. I\'ve already got my name, address, phone number, credit card number, mother\'s maiden name, and cat\'s favorite breakfast cereal entered into dozens of online shopping sites, and it was a five-to-ten-minute process every single time. And then I get the thrill of trying to remember dozens of different logon IDs and passwords. If all I want to do is read a webcomic or download a piece of music, going through the entire signup process just doesn\'t make sense.\n\nEnter BitPass. The system works like a prepaid phone card. You can start up an account with as little as US$3.00. As you purchase content from sites that use BitPass, it deducts money from your account, and when you run out, adding more money is ridiculously simple. BitPass is unobtrusive and so easy to use it\'s almost silly.\n\nI ran across the system at <a href=\"http://www.scottmccloud.com/\">Scott McCloud\'s Web site</a>. Scott is selling access to his new online comic, <a href=\"http://scottmccloud.com/comics/trn/intro.html\"><em>The Right Number</em></a>. I clicked the Read It Now link on his page, and I was taken to a BitPass signup window. I gave BitPass my PayPal information, made a password, put three bucks into my new account, and I was reading the comic. Less than two minutes, all told. It probably takes a little longer than that if you sign up with a credit card instead of an existing PayPal account, but you only have to do it <em>once</em>.\n\nScott is charging 25 cents to read his comic. Not only is this more than reasonable for quality content like Scott\'s, it\'s probably a far greater amount than he\'d make by selling the comic to a publisher. Having had <a href=\"http://www.palmosbible.com/\" title=\"Palm OS Programming Bible\">my own</a> dealings with the publishing industry, I can say from experience that the vast majority of the cover price of a book does <em>not</em> go into the pocket of the author.\n\nI followed a few links to someone else who is distributing music via BitPass. Joshua Ellis, whose <a href=\"http://www.zenarchery.com/\">weblog</a> I\'ve been reading irregularly ever since I found it a few months ago, has a new album online titled <a href=\"http://www.zenarchery.com/music/lsfb/\"><em>Love Songs for Bastards</em></a>. Joshua is selling individual songs for 50 cents, or the entire album and interactive liner notes for US$3.50. If anything, the record industry is far worse than the publishing industry about getting money to artists, which makes BitPass an excellent opportunity for musicians to actually make money from their music. It makes me smile to think that Joshua actually gets to keep most of the $3.50 that I shelled out for his quirky, eclectic album.\n\nThe other nice thing about a micropayment system is that, if I only want access to a single piece of content, there\'s no need to sign up for a yearly subscription.

Aaron describes it in a <a href=\"http://www.palminfocenter.com/view_story.asp?ID=5619\">PalmInfocenter post</a> as a BIOS abstraction layer. SHARK handles basic input and output, so it\'s not a lowest common denominator attempt at a global UI library.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of libraries that will run on top of SHARK (already in development), there will also be common abstraction layers for database management, user interface, and high-level networking protocols like <acronym title=\"File Transfer Protocol\">FTP</acronym> and <acronym title=\"HyperText Transfer Protocol\">HTTP</acronym>. The current release supports Palm OS, Pocket PC, Smartphone 2002, Symbian Series 60, and Windows, and more platforms are on the way.\r\n\r\nMobile Wizardry has already been using the platform to develop a new <a href=\"http://www.mobilewizardry.com/multi-platform/oceana-preview.jpg\">multi-platform game</a>. Given that Mobile Wizardry\'s focus is on games, and Aaron\'s history of mercilessly pestering PalmSource to provide better support for games development in the Palm OS, I have no doubt that SHARK is as lean and fast as it can be. The sample apps on Mobile Wizardry\'s page run very nicely on Windows and my CLIÃ‰ NX70V, and they\'re not hugely bloated application files, either.\r\n\r\nI\'ve got a couple of Palm OS development projects on the back burner that would really benefit from multi-platform releases, and this sounds like a great platform to toy with.','SHARK multi-platform handheld development',0,'','publish','open','open','','shark-multi-platform-handheld-development','','','2008-04-04 17:09:22','2008-04-05 00:09:22','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/2003/07/10/shark-multi-platform-handheld-development/',0,'post','',0),(158,2,'2003-07-17 10:59:20','2003-07-17 17:59:20','Sony\'s managed to make an even weirder handheld than their current series of twisty-screen devices (NX, NV series). They\'re announcing the <a href=\"http://www.sony.jp/products/Consumer/PEG/PEG-UX50/feat1.html\">PEG-UX50</a> (Japanese site; more in English at <a title=\"Brighthand: Sony Announcing New Wireless Handheld This Week\" href=\"http://www.brighthand.com/article/Sony_Announcing_Wireless_Handheld_on_Friday\">Brighthand</a>), a bizarre clamshell design that resembles a miniature notebook computer. It\'s still got the twisty-screen feature of their current top-end handhelds, so it transforms from very small notebook to very small tablet PC.\n\nIt\'s got both Bluetooth and WiFi built-in, along with 22MB of RAM that function kind of like an internal, unremovable Memory Stick. The extra memory is for media: images, movies, voice recordings, MP3s and such. Theoretically, you could use it without a memory stick, but as I\'ve discovered, I personally can\'t live with less than a 64MB Memory Stick attached to my handheld, and I swap that out for a 128 when I want to listen to music.\n\nThe landscape screen orientation makes my head hurt. It looks like they\'ve shoved the Graffiti area onto the right side of the screen, with a numbers-over-letters orientation that\'s guaranteed to cause cognitive dissonance for long-time Palm OS users like me. Unless you can customize it, the Graffiti area will be totally useless to lefties, too.\n\nThe keyboard is larger than that on earlier Sony offerings, owing largely to the landscape orientation. Combined with the dual onboard wireless and a digital camera, this would be a fabulous moblogging tool. It\'s also nearly two ounces lighter than my NX70V, which would make my trousers sag a bit less when it\'s in my pocket.\n\nI\'m not sure I\'d be able to use the UX50 without going totally barking mad, though. It\'s as much a departure from the Palm OS mainstream as the NR70 was when it came out. Amazing how attached we get to interfaces when we use them on a daily basis.\n','Sony have out-weirded themselves again',0,'\n','publish','open','open','','sony-have-out-weirded-themselves-again','','','2003-07-17 10:59:20','2003-07-17 17:59:20','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/2003/07/17/sony-have-out-weirded-themselves-again/',0,'post','',0),(159,2,'2003-07-17 12:07:22','2003-07-17 19:07:22','<a href=\"http://www.anvilon.com/\">Eric Hammond</a> has a great <a title=\"notlong: Web Sites That Shorten Long URLs\" href=\"http://notlong.com/links/\">comparison of Web sites that shorten long URLs</a>.

VICTORY, as outlined in this <a href=\"http://www.libertythink.com/2003_08_10_archives.html#106089517667334786\">early draft</a>, adds to the civil liberties damage already done by the PATRIOT Act.\n\nAshcroft is <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/08-06-2003/news/wn_report/story/106872p-96686c.html\">going on tour</a> to support the VICTORY Act, legislation aimed to prevent \"narco-terrorism\". The act includes provisions to punish \"reverse money-laundering\" (no, I haven\'t been able to figure out what that means, and I\'ve read the text four times now), extend prison sentences for a number of nonviolent drug-related (and unrelated) crimes, and greatly extend asset forfeiture powers possessed by the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nMy personal comments to Ashcroft in the Dean petition:\n\nbq. The attacks of September 11, 2001 were designed to disrupt the American way of life. They have succeeded because of this administration\'s failure to recognize that the American way of life is deeply rooted in personal freedoms. Yes, steps must be taken to more closely monitor terrorist organizations. Yes, we need better security for airports and vital infrastructure. Yes, we have been lax in our vigilance. But if measures intended to stop terrorism trample the civil rights of American citizens, we have handed the terrorists a victory they could not achieve with any number of suicidal attacks: the destruction of the American way of life. We will have become exactly what the terrorists would have us become: a paranoid police state whose citizens live in fear of not only terror attacks, but their own government and their fellow citizens.\n\nbq. Protecting the basic civil liberties granted by our Constitution is the best way we have to show terrorists that their vicious tactics are ultimately futile. We must set an example as a nation where anyone\'s views may be heard, no matter how unpopular, without reprisal. The free exchange of ideas is crucial to the maintenance of a fair and just democracy in America. Legislation like the USA PATRIOT Act only serves to prevent public debate, forcing our best and brightest to keep silent for fear of reprisal from their government and those who do not share their ideas.\n','Dean petition against Ashcroft',0,'\n','publish','open','open','','dean-petition-against-ashcroft','','','2003-08-20 13:48:12','2003-08-20 20:48:12','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/2003/08/20/dean-petition-against-ashcroft/',0,'post','',0),(174,2,'2003-08-20 16:06:53','2003-08-20 23:06:53','UC Berkeley physicists have created a <a href=\"http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/07/23_motor.shtml\" title=\" Physicists build world\'s smallest motor using nanotubes and etched silicon\">tiny electric motor</a> that measures only 500 nanometers across.

I\'ve copied the necessary files to my Memory Stick, though, for future use.

My brain is rather hopelessly cross-wired with complicated control key combinations for invoking text-editing functions, everything from the common (C-a for beginning of the current line) to the obscure (C-x, Enter, f to change the text coding system of the current document).\n\nUnfortunately, I also use Windows applications extensively, and they use a completely different set of hotkeys. I\'ve managed to partially lobotomize Word into thinking it\'s Emacs with a few macros and key customizations (like C-a for beginning of line), but some things are impossible (like anything having a C-x prefix). I have to make a conscious effort to switch myself out of Emacs mode and into Word mode before I start typing, or I end up doing very strange things to my documents. For example, Ctrl+A in Word and Notepad doesn\'t go to beginning of line, it selects all the text in the current document, which is potentially disastrous.\n\n<a title=\"XKeymacs\" href=\"http://www.cam.hi-ho.ne.jp/oishi/indexen.html\">XKeymacs</a> might solve some of my problems. It\'s a taskbar application that intercepts key input and translates it, with reasonable success, into its equivalent in Windows applications. For example, C-s (Emacs search) invokes the Find command in Notepad and Word (normally Ctrl+F) instead of Save, and C-x C-s invokes Save as I\'m used to in Emacs. XKeymacs has a few dozen little check boxes full of settings to turn on and off (mostly individual control- and meta-key combinations), and you can set it not to be active in certain applications if that interferes too much with their regular operation. After a brief tour of its settings, it looks like you can completely remap your keyboard if you want to, meaning that hardcore Unix geeks who are used to DEC keyboards with the Ctrl key in the \"proper\" place (where Caps Lock is on most PC keyboards) can move it there.\n\nIt\'s just beginning to dawn on me what a paradigm-shifting piece of software this could be for me. I realized a few sentences ago that I\'d already instinctively started using Emacs cursor commands while writing this blog entry in Windows Mozilla Firebird, which normally uses Windows editing hotkeys in a browser text area control.

The idea being that your house paint would be a clear coat with tiny electronically-changeable pigments floating around in the paint.\n\nGiven the direction that \"flexible LCD screens\":http://www.nature.com/nsu/030505/030505-6.html are going, it probably won\'t be too long before some bright scientist or engineer figures out how to spray a liquid crystal display onto a surface. The hard part is getting what starts out as a soup of random microelectronic components to align themselves properly as the \"paint\" dries. You could possibly run a current through the paint to get everything aligned properly.\n\nThis is the kind of job that is tailor-made for a mature nanotechnology. If all the elements in the paint could simply move _themselves_ into the correct positions, you wouldn\'t even need to do anything special while the paint is drying. Assuming that making the nanomachines in the paint is feasible, the other problem to overcome is in software. You\'d need a display driver that can cope with an irregularly-shaped surface, composed of near-randomly distributed pixels. The nanomachines, now embedded in the dried surface, could help out a little here by sending diagnostic signals back to a controlling computer, which could then organically assemble code that can control the new display. Essentially, the controller would _grow_ its own driver, based on feedback from the nanocircuitry in the paint.\n\nThe fun part about this idea is that it\'s not limited to houses or cars, as described in Mike\'s article. I\'d love to see this embedded in clothing, or even in the first few layers of skin. _Tattoos_ that you can change on a whim -- or even animate -- would be an awful lot of fun.\n','Electronic house paint',0,'\n','publish','open','open','','electronic-house-paint','','','2003-11-03 16:08:35','2003-11-03 23:08:35','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/2003/11/03/electronic-house-paint/',0,'post','',0),(214,2,'2003-11-04 09:30:45','2003-11-04 16:30:45','Bruce Sterling, talented author and long-time member of the online technorati, is back on the Web again after a hiatus this summer.

I got mail yesterday from Red Hat Network, informing me that the days of automating my fileserver maintenance are coming to a close.\n\nbq.. Dear lonnonf,\n\nThank you for being a Red Hat Network customer.\n\nThis e-mail provides you with important information about the upcoming discontinuation of Red Hat Linux, and resources to assist you with your migration to another Red Hat solution.\n\nAs previously communicated, Red Hat will discontinue maintenance and errata support for Red Hat Linux 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 and 8.0 as of December 31, 2003. Red Hat will discontinue maintenance and errata support for Red Hat Linux 9 as of April 30, 2004. Red Hat does not plan to release another product in the Red Hat Linux line.\n\nWith the recent announcement of Red Hat Enterprise Linux v.3, you\'ll find migrating to Enterprise Linux appealing.  We understand that transitioning to another Red Hat solution requires careful planning and implementation.  We have created a migration plan for Red Hat Network customers to help make the transition as simple and seamless as possible.\n\np. This is a move that has a lot of people upset; \"Slashdot\":http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/11/03/1749259&mode=thread&tid=106&tid=110&tid=126&tid=163&tid=185&tid=187 has a good cross section of both angry supporters and angry detractors of RHN(Red Had Network)\'s decision. Personally I can\'t say I\'m surprised; providing an infrastructure for free updates to older versions of Linux wasn\'t going to make Red Hat a lot of money, and it was only a matter of time until management decided to invoke the bottom line.\n\nThe part that mystifies me, though, is the name switch to Fedora for the free, open source Red Hat Linux. From Red Hat\'s \"Linux Migration Resource Center\":http://www.redhat.com/solutions/migration/rhl/rhn/:\n\nbq..:http://www.redhat.com/solutions/migration/rhl/rhn/ A few years ago there was just one Red Hat Linux. As acceptance grew and Linux reached further into enterprise computing, one Red Hat Linux product could no longer be all things to all users. That\'s why in 2002 Red Hat created what\'s now known as Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Stable, supported, certified--Red Hat Enterprise Linux has become the corporate Linux standard.\n\nThe Fedora Project was introduced in late 2003. Built for and with the help of the open source community, the Fedora Project is for developers and early high-tech enthusiasts using Linux in non-critical computing environments.\n\np. Dropping the Red Hat name for the open source distribution isn\'t good public relations. Red Hat became the most widely used Linux distro because a lot of people liked using the free version at home, then brought it into the workplace and put a lot of effort into convincing their managers it was a good idea to run an operating system developed by a random and global assortment of hackers.\n\nDividing Red Hat into Red Hat Enterprise and Fedora has turned Red Hat Linux into a pay-to-play operating system. Given the pricing for Red Hat Enterprise, which in some subscription plans isn\'t even competitive with Microsoft offerings, there will be a lot of hobbyists and freelancers moving to other Linux distributions. There might still be some synergy between Fedora and the enterprise Red Hat, but because they\'ll be separate codebases, they\'re bound to diverge. Red Hat is likely to lose a lot of its support from former fans who can\'t be bothered to keep current on two versions of the operating system at once.\n\nIf anyone can recommend a good Linux distribution, with brain-dead easy updating to keep it current with security patches, I\'m all ears. The real beauty of Red Hat was Red Hat Network, which made updating the system nearly automatic, and would have been fully automatic if I\'d had the bucks to shell out for an RHN(Red Hat Network) account. I want my fileserver to be a machine that I just don\'t worry about. It\'s an appliance, and shouldn\'t require constant fiddling to keep it in good working order.\n','Nice while it lasted',0,'\n','publish','open','open','','nice-while-it-lasted','','','2003-11-04 12:02:10','2003-11-04 19:02:10','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/2003/11/04/nice-while-it-lasted/',0,'post','',0),(216,2,'2003-11-04 12:38:19','2003-11-04 19:38:19','I\'ve been trying to find some easy way to use \"Textile\":http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/ formatting in this blog to create multiple-paragraph blockquotes, in which all the paragraphs are contained within a single @<blockquote>@ tag.

Which should render something like this:\n\nbq.. This is the first paragraph.\n\nThis is the second paragraph.\n\np. Up to this point, I\'ve been using a separate @bq.@ formatting directive for every paragraph in the blockquote. The Textile source looks like this:\n\n==\n<pre>bq. This is the first paragraph.\n\nbq.

This wouldn\'t be a big deal, except that I\'m thinking of changing the CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) formatting for a @<blockquote>@ tag to something with a different background color, or perhaps surrounded by a box, and I don\'t want separate individual boxes appearing for each paragraph of the blockquote, as in this example:\n\np(({border: 1px solid #666}. This is the first paragraph.\n\np(({border: 1px solid #666}. This is the second paragraph.\n\nFortunately, \"MT-Textile 2\":http://www.bradchoate.com/past/001653.php#001653 has syntax that solves this problem. \"Brad Choate\":http://www.bradchoate.com/, the author of MT-Textile, doesn\'t have all the new syntax properly documented yet (MT-Textile\'s still in beta, so it\'s forgivable), but one of his \"test case pages\":http://www.bradchoate.com/cvs/textile/testcases.txt?annotate=1.2 has provided me with a wealth of new tags that already work in MT-Textile 2. Thank goodness for \"Google\":http://www.google.com/, which produced the test case page with the search terms \"textile multiple paragraph blockquote\".\n\nThe new syntax that makes my little dreams come true is the \"sticky\" indicator, formed by tacking a second period (full stop for those of you on the other side of the Atlantic) onto the end of the @bq.@ directive. The proper MT-Textile 2 formatting for my example looks like this:\n\nbc.. bq.. This is the first paragraph.\n\nThis is the second paragraph.\n\np. To end the sticky behavior, simply start the next paragraph with @p.@. It\'s an elegant solution for an elegant markup system.\n\nThe more I look at MT-Textile 2, the more in awe I am of Brad and \"Dean Allen\":http://www.textism.com/, Textile\'s original creator. Their collaboration is producing an easy to type markup that\'s remarkably intuitive to use. I wasn\'t really using the original MT-Textile much, instead dropping HTML(HyperText Markup Language) coding into my blog entries. Now that I\'ve started digging through the second version\'s hidden features, I\'m tapping out all my blog entries using Textile. It\'s a lot easier to key in, and a heck of a lot more readable for not having to visually parse angle brackets.

Cory Doctorow has an excellent \"article on trademark law\":http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2003/08/14/trademarks.html, and its abuses by overly-litigious corporate entities. Corporations, spurred on by their legal counsel, have become paranoid about maintaining 100% control over their trademarks, when such control is impossible in the face of legal, public usage of trademarks in day-to-day speech.\r\n\r\nThe irony is that the biggest mark of success in marketing a brand -- its adoption as a household word -- threatens to undermine the brand name as a trademark. Current trademark law sets companies up for failure. The more your brand becomes associated with a product or service, the more people generically use the brand in conversation, and the risk of losing control of your trademark increases. Placing the legal onus of defending a trademark on the company that owns it causes many corporations to waste millions of dollars on litigation of perceived trademark misuses.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nTrademarks exist to protect consumers from ethically corrupt companies who might wish to market their inferior product under a competitor\'s brand name. Cory argues that non-commercial uses of trademarks are never infringing, and even commercial uses that don\'t cause confusion are perfectly acceptable. Many law firms treat trademark law as a license to print money, insisting to their clients that the only way to protect a trademark is to go after every single person who utters the trademark without due reverence and capitalization.\r\n\r\nAs a victim of this stupidity (see the notes on my former \"Lava Lamp\":http://tribble.dreamhost.com/useless.php software toy), I\'m fed up with trademark law in the United States. The law as it stands hurts consumers rather than protecting them by forcing corporations to become language police. I\'m a strong believer that, to truly benefit an economy, money spent should produce something useful, and spurious legal bills are anything but. Trademark law must be reformed to prevent the waste of millions of dollars that could go toward improving the economy.','Cory Doctorow on trademark law',0,'','publish','open','open','','cory-doctorow-on-trademark-law','','','2008-04-04 15:59:48','2008-04-04 22:59:48','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/2003/11/10/cory-doctorow-on-trademark-law/',0,'post','',0),(237,2,'2003-11-10 11:59:00','2003-11-10 18:59:00','\"Dean Allen\":http://www.textism.com/, creator of the \"Textile\":http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/ human Web text generator, has another nifty tool that I\'d overlooked.

By contrast, in the construction of the Panama Canal, 72.6 million cubic meters were excavated, and the Great Pyramid occupies 2.4 million cubic meters.

Backed up by information presentation theorist Edward Tufte (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0961392118/\"><em>Envisioning Information</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0961392142/\"><em>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em></a>), Clive makes a compelling case that Powerpoint is contributing to the dumbing down of communication.\r\n\r\nPowerpoint encourages very low density of information in each slide. This isn\'t necessarily a bad thing. In a presentation, a couple of bulleted points on the overhead projector can serve to highlight and drive home the message delivered by a talented speaker.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I\'ve witnessed far too many business presentations in which the speaker merely reads directly from Powerpoint slides. In the effort to pare down information so it will fit on those little slides, anything meaningful is lost, a process that turns any presentation into a brief sales pitch.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIf the speaker does go to the effort to cram lots of information onto those slides, more often than not the presentation turns into a snooze fest as the speaker reads every word verbatim. And if the speaker doesn\'t dwell on every single word in every slide, the information whips past quickly enough that there\'s no way to absorb it.\r\n\r\nAs early as the sixth grade, I learned the fundamentals of presenting information to a group of people. Cue cards are an important part of this process: a small stack of notes to guide the speaker through a presentation. Visual aids to the presentation are a separate item, usually containing little text and instead presenting a graphical display to augment the verbal information delivered by the speaker.\r\n\r\nWhere Powerpoint gets it wrong is in encouraging people to project their cue cards on the wall. Those notes are for the speaker and the speaker alone. There\'s no reason for someone to verbalize text if everyone in the audience is going to read it themselves; you may as well run the presentation as a silent movie, swapping slides at long intervals. Or better yet, print it out or stick it on a Web page so they can read it at their leisure. Don\'t insult your audience\'s intelligence by assuming its members can\'t read for themselves.\r\n\r\nI\'ve also seen too many companies, otherwise full of talented and intelligent people, that offer Powerpoint files as <em>documentation</em>. The short format and lack of useful document structure inherent to Powerpoint precludes its use for imparting information without help from a speaker. Please, if you think your information is important enough to publish for public consumption, give it the attention it deserves. Write a paper, or a book, or a help system, or a Web site; don\'t foist sound bites and bullet points on your customers.\r\n\r\nDon\'t get me wrong, Powerpoint can serve a useful purpose. With some effort and skill, it can produce compelling visual aids for a verbal presentation, along with separate speaker\'s notes (cue cards) that the audience need never see. However, it requires forethought and careful design to make an effective presentation. The wizards and default templates included with Powerpoint lull too many would-be presenters into thinking the project is mostly complete. Designing a presentation requires time, and should not be relegated to the last-minute status it all too often receives.','Yes, dear, Powerpoint really is evil',0,'','publish','open','open','','yes-dear-powerpoint-really-is-evil','','','2008-04-04 12:51:02','2008-04-04 19:51:02','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/2003/12/17/yes-dear-powerpoint-really-is-evil/',0,'post','',2),(285,2,'2003-12-17 18:05:45','2003-12-18 01:05:45','<a href=\"http://www.maxdesign.com.au/\">Max Design</a> has a fantastic series of <a href=\"http://css.maxdesign.com.au/index.htm\"><acronym title=\"Cascading Style Sheets\">CSS</acronym> tutorials</a>.

In 2003, we should either have returned to hand-made goods, or we should have all forgotten handicrafts and become interested only in mass-produced items. We\'ve managed to do both; presents continue to be a mix of handicrafts and manufactured goods.

Kinoma Player isn\'t bad if you\'ve already got your video in Kinoma format, but waiting for Kinoma Producer to convert even a small movie (say, 320Ã—480, only a minute in length) is a five minute or longer process.

Largely, this was a result of not wanting to repeat herself every time someone wants a status report on recent events in our little family, particularly our latest electrical and plumbing fiasco.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the long form of the electrical nightmare is thus:\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\nOn Saturday, 24 January, our cable TV started to go on the fritz. At first, it was just intermittent service, but by Sunday, the cable had gone completely, including our cable Internet service. We called Comcast to have one of their technicians come out and get things up and running again.\r\n\r\nTuesday, 27 January rolls around, and the cable guy shows up to repair the cable. I was occupying myself by playing Ratchet and Clank while he puttered about. He went outside to fiddle with the cable box. Suddenly, Ratchet and Clank disappeared as most of the breakers in the house slammed firmly to the \"off\" state. I dashed downstairs to the breaker box to see what\'s going on, and noticed great gouts of black smoke pouring forth from the TV, VCR, and cable box in Zen\'s room.\r\n\r\nAfter quickly turning off the mains and unplugging the burning A/V wreckage, I ran outside to see what the hell the cable guy was doing. He said that he got a big ol\' blue spark when he disconnected the cable from the house, and then all the power went dead a half a minute later (which would have been me turning off the mains). Before the power went dead, he touched a few spots in the cable box with a multimeter and found out that the entire house had been <em>grounding through the cable</em>. This is, as they say, a Bad Thing.\r\n\r\nThe cable technician climbed the pole across the street and found that about two feet of the cable had been fried, burning its way through the insulation from the inside out. That explained our lack of cable signal, but not why the house had been grounding through the cable in the first place. After repairing the cable to the pole, he let me know that I\'d need to get the house electrical system repaired before Comcast would hook another wire to our house. That seemed perfectly reasonable to me, given the extra crispy nature of the cable that he replaced.\r\n\r\nI called an electrician, who showed up later that afternoon. After unplugging everything I could think of in the house, we turned the mains back on, and he went about the house with a multimeter, getting a more and more confused look on his face the longer he tested outlets, switch plates, and lighting fixtures. At one point, with multimeter attached to a nearby outlet, he got a completely different reading every time he switched the same circuit on and off. Given the ordinarily binary nature of turning a single circuit on and off, this was disturbing, to say the least.\r\n\r\nHe came just shy of pronouncing the house possessed and recommending that I find a good priest and some holy water. Instead, he suggested that the house probably needed to be completely rewired, and that at a rough guess I could expect to pay US$15,000 for the privilege and that such a job could take a few months to complete. Yuck.\r\n\r\nElisabeth, Zen, and I gathered a small percentage of our worldly goods and moved into Elisabeth\'s mom\'s place for the remainder of the week while we talked to other electricians and the insurance company and figured out what the hell we were going to do. We also discovered that Azymuth, one of our cats, had gone missing during the day, which we attributed to not having nearly enough to stress out about. He turned up a couple days later; apparently, he\'d just gone to ground somewhere inside the house and just refused to have anything to do with people who weren\'t capable of keeping a house\'s electrical system in working order.\r\n\r\nOver the course of the week, we found some more competent electricians in the form of Green Lake Electric, who I highly recommend to anyone in the Seattle area in need of electrical work (more on that later). They went through the house with Elisabeth and completely mapped its strange new electrical topography. Many heads were scratched and many theories were put forward on what had happened. The only thing anyone could agree upon is that the house had lost its neutral, but nobody could quite guess why. At this stage, the electricians said that they may need to rip up several walls to find which junctions had been fried, because the only thing that seemed capable of causing the weird results they were getting was one or more short circuits in places they couldn\'t get to.\r\n\r\nWe moved from Elisabeth\'s mom\'s place to Ken\'s place, convinced so far by the experts that we were in for an extended period of not living at home. By far the best statement from an electrician during this time was that, in the few rare cases they\'d seen something similar to what had happened to our home, the problem was usually discovered when the roof caught fire. Without a proper ground, something in a wall somewhere tended to heat up and ignite the house\'s insulation, racing up the wall and turning the upper part of the house into a raging inferno. Apparently, fate smiles upon geeks and tea shop owners, because the worst that happened was the loss of several appliances (refrigerator, chest freezer, toaster), some A/V equipment (two cable boxes, a TV, a VCR), and a couple of computers (whose hard drives miraculously survived).\r\n\r\nThe nice folks from Allstate sent a claims adjuster over to assess how much of this mess would be covered under insurance. While he was at the house with Elisabeth and one of the electricians, an inspector from Seattle City Light dropped by so the city could add its two cents to the mounting price tag. A grizzled veteran of electrical work, he took a look at something that everyone else had assumed was perfectly fine: the power line from the pole to the house. The clouds parted (literally), and he was able to spy a point on the line where the beautiful magnolia tree in front of our house had eaten its way through the neutral line. It was so subtle that when the weather turned grey again, one could hardly see the place where the line was damaged. At long last, we had a root cause (branch cause, perhaps?) for the whole mess.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I feel it necessary to mention what a great guy our insurance agent is. David Olliver secured for us a home owner\'s policy that provided not only compensation for repairs to the electrical system, not only money to purchase damaged and destroyed appliances, but also enough to cover the cost of bringing the house up to current electrical code, a requirement when such a massive amount of electrical work must be done to a house. Our electrical system, originally installed in 1928 and further mangled by a former owner some time during the 50s, was well behind code, requiring the installation of more than a dozen new outlets and light switches, along with a smoke detector system. All of it covered by insurance. Thank you, David.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the insurance covered lodging in a hotel. We moved from Ken\'s to our semi-permanent base of operations at the Marriott Residence Inn on the south shore of Lake Union, near downtown Seattle. It was an improvement in commute from Ken\'s place in Issaquah for all three of us, and they had no problem with taking in Storm, as well. It takes a lot of guts for a hotel to allow guests to board a Basenji, and we salute the bravery of the fine folks at Marriott. With the cats being taken care of by another friend, Karen, we settled into something approximating normalcy while the electrical contractors did their thing.\r\n\r\nAnother inspector from the city performed an impedance test, and it turned out that, while not the root cause of the problem, the old knob and tube wiring had been completely fried during the incident, and needed to be replaced. Fortunately, the guys at Green Lake Electric are true pros, and they were able to replace the old wiring and bring the rest of the house up to code in less than a week. On top of it all, they left such tiny holes where they did their work that it won\'t be hard, or terribly expensive, for someone else to come in and repair the walls. Again, I highly recommend Green Lake Electric; these guys rock.\r\n\r\nWe moved back into the house last Saturday (14 February) after 17 days away from the house. We\'ve got a refrigerator again, and with a little work yesterday, we\'ve got some of the house back to normal. There are still stacks of boxes in the basement and elsewhere in the house that contain the contents of whole rooms (moved aside to allow the electricians space to work), but we\'re slowly getting back to normal. We\'ve just hit a small snag with a <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/tealynx/913.html#cutid1\">plumbing problem</a>, about which Elisabeth goes into great detail in her LiveJournal.\r\n\r\nIf there\'s a moral to the story, it\'s probably to make sure your insurance agent is a genius. We\'ve still got a fair amount of out-of-pocket expense due to this little adventure, but no so much that we need to consider donating important organs to make up the cost.','Elisabeth on LiveJournal, and electrical hoo-ha',0,'','publish','open','open','','elisabeth-on-livejournal-and-electrical-hoo-ha','','','2008-04-03 22:50:12','2008-04-04 05:50:12','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/2004/02/22/elisabeth-on-livejournal-and-electrical-hoo-ha/',0,'post','',0),(301,2,'2004-02-22 20:33:36','2004-02-23 03:33:36','Ever needed to find a proper, scientific name for a class of critters, such as \"bovine\" for cows or \"lupine\" for wolves?

With her friends Ron Stoppable (always accompanied by his naked mole rat, Rufus) and Wade (who never appears in person, only on Ms. Possible\'s \"Kimmunicator\"), she keeps the world safe from evil masterminds.

I haven\'t laughed this hard at a cartoon since <em>Samurai Jack</em> debuted a few years ago.\r\n\r\nAs any good obsession revolving around a specific piece of intellectual property will do, <em>Kim Possible</em> has driven me to scour the Web for desktop wallpaper, cell phone ring tones, and whatever other digital tchotchke I can point my browser at.

It runs on a Linux and X Windows base, with a 206MHz processor, 64MB of RAM, 32MB of \"permanent storage\" (flash memory, I\'d assume), and a pair of USB ports.\r\n\r\nAmong the more innovative features is a built-in accelerometer, which allows the user to control applications by moving the handheld around or wiggling it in certain directions. For example, flicking your wrist a bit can turn pages in an electronic book, or rotating the device ninety degrees switches between portrait and landscape display of images.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIt comes with a vast array of applications, from the usual date book and memo pad, to \"Panchanga\", an astrology program for planning events during auspicious times of day. It\'s got support for English, Hindi, and Kannada text, and if the screen shots are any indication, it looks like you can annotate most applications by scribbling digital ink directly over the application.\r\n\r\nI\'m curious what the reaction at PalmSource and Microsoft is. If the Amida works as well as advertised, it\'s easily competetive with high-end handhelds running Palm OS or Windows Mobile. Amida appears to be primarily targeted at the Indian market, but given that it\'s already a trilingual device, it could become another important player in the global mobile devices market.\r\n\r\nThere are three versions available: a high-end consumer model with 64K-color TFT screen, a low-end consumer model with a greyscale screen, and an enterprise model with a greyscale screen and fewer bells and whistles.

Here\'s a question I received from a friend via email:\r\n\r\nbq. Does this mean they are stopping forever?\r\n\r\nOnly Sony knows the answer to that question. I don\'t think they\'re likely to give up on the PDA entirely, especially because they\'re still planning to produce new models in Japan. PDAs of all kinds haven\'t sold as well in the last year or two as they did in previous years, and there are a lot of people in the industry who think that convergence devices, like smartphones, are the right direction to look for future small electronics.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nMy guess is that Sony might develop Palm OS-based smartphones through their Sony Ericsson division. At the very least, they\'re still producing their existing line of PDAs, which they\'ll still be selling for a while; they\'re just not going to release any new models in the U.S.\r\n\r\nI don\'t think the dedicated PDA is likely to completely disappear, despite the dire predictions analysts are making. In the consumer electronics space, they\'re not going to sell as well as devices that are able to make calls, take pictures, play music, and make coffee. As electronic components become smaller, cheaper, and higher quality, carrying a single device instead of a PDA, cell phone, MP3 player, digital camera, and coffee maker makes more sense, but only if someone can manufacture a device that\'s able to do all of those functions well.\r\n\r\nDedicated handheld computers are likely to be around for a while, because they make more sense in the enterprise space. A large company that uses PDAs for a custom sales force application, for instance, isn\'t going to want to pay extra for a coffee maker on their employees\' PDAs, especially when they can get just the PDA by itself dirt cheap.\r\n\r\nThe other thing dedicated PDAs have in their favor is that they are very good at what they do. I\'m sure someone clever will eventually figure out how to make a converged device that does everything well, but so far, you end up with a half-assed effort at all the individual parts. The PDA is harder to use because of the form factor; the phone doesn\'t get the reception of a true cell phone; the camera takes fuzzy pictures; the coffee tastes like motor oil. I know several people on the upper end of the gadget freak market who carry a separate MP3 player from their music-playing PDA, simply because it plays music better than the PDA can. And if it\'s an <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ipodmini/\">iPod Mini</a> that you want, why buy anything else?\r\n\r\nAnd then there\'s my wife\'s argument against a combined PDA and cell phone: what do you do when someone asks you for a telephone number?\r\n<blockquote>\"Yes, I\'ve got that right here. Just a moment.\"\r\n\r\n[move cell phone from ear so you can look at the screen and use the stylus]\r\n\r\n\"Hang on. Almost got it.\"\r\n\r\n[make loud scratching and tapping noises while looking up the number]\r\n\r\n\"Okay here it is.\"\r\n\r\n[move phone away from ear to look at number]\r\n\r\n\"206...\"\r\n\r\n[move phone away again]\r\n\r\n\"555...\"\r\n\r\n[move phone away again]\r\n\r\n\"8974.\"\r\n\r\n[glance at phone again]\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, sorry, it\'s 8947. Got that?\"\r\n\r\n[check number again]\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, I missed that; I was looking at the phone while you were talking. Say again?\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you want his address, too?\"</blockquote>\r\nThis scenario isn\'t as problematic if you\'ve got a headset, but who wants to take the time to plug in and use a headset every single time a call comes in? Bluetooth headsets are a bit more convenient (you can skip the plugging in step), but at $150 or more for one that I\'d actually consider using, they\'re a bit steep. I\'m not on the phone <em>that</em> often.\r\n\r\nI think eventually, when all the bugs have been hammered out and the public has been forced to endure a series of truly terrible convergence devices (like the Nokia N-Gage, a combined cell phone and game console that performs neither function well), someone will hit upon a perfect combination. Handspring/palmOne already did a great job with the Treo 600, as I\'m sure any Treo 600 user will tell you. It will just be a while before the device can also take great photos, play clear and crisp music, and serve up fabulous coffee.','The future of PDAs',0,'','publish','open','open','','the-future-of-pdas','','','2008-04-09 17:31:15','2008-04-10 00:31:15','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/2004/06/14/the-future-of-pdas/',0,'post','',3),(324,2,'2004-07-20 13:36:58','2004-07-20 20:36:58','My new job at <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com\">Amazon.com</a> has thrown me head-first into a sea of new acronyms surrounding web services.

It\'s interesting to hear some of the writer\'s thoughts on politics and society in an interview format instead of embedded in one of his stories. It\'s also a bit freakish to compare the fascist English state in <em>V for Vendetta</em> with the current trends in the United States. One quote in particular stands out:\r\n<blockquote>Well, the one thing with writing stories about the rise of fascism is that if you wait long enough, you\'ll almost certainly be proved right. Fascism is like a hydra -- you can cut off its head in the Germany of the \'30s and \'40s, but it\'ll still turn up on your back doorstep in a slightly altered guise. I\'d agree that the current situation is particularly alarming. I tend to think that this momentum seems to have sprung up entirely from a group of largely discredited, extreme right-wingers who have been skulking in the shadows since the Ford administration and have suddenly come into the light of day surrounding George W.

And like most of the PC-gaming public, I\'m enjoying the hell out of the game (pun fully intended).

The game has at least as much plot as you\'d expect from the average sci-fi/horror/thriller film, and voice acting that is even more convincing than most performances from the film genre. The interactive computer displays and PDA do a really good job of adding life to what could otherwise be nothing more than a playable technology demo.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nAnd how does it look? The screen shots posted far and wide across the Web do not do this game justice. When everything is <em>moving</em>, it forms its own reality, one in which happy thoughts are completely banished. The game is dark, but dark in the right places; Doom 3\'s lighting reminds me of the terrifying moments I had in Doom and Doom 2 when the lights would go out and a swarm of pinkies would descend upon me.\r\n\r\nAdd the sound, and you\'ve got a game that threatens to dampen your trousers at every turn. Not only are all the bad guy noises executed with appropriate menace, but the environmental sounds make the entire UAC Mars base feel like a bad place to be. You can listen to the thoughts of station personnel via audio journals while you continue exploring, and the panicked radio traffic from your fellow marines adds to the feeling that you\'re going to die if you\'re not really quick with that shotgun.\r\n\r\nThe AI in the game isn\'t impressive. Most non-zombie opponents don\'t charge straight at you, but they don\'t do much other than shoot or try to rip your limbs off. After Half-Life and Halo, it\'s hard to switch back to enemies that aren\'t terribly bright. I\'m not far into the game, though, and I have hopes that more intelligent opponents might be forthcoming.\r\n\r\nHowever, lack of AI doesn\'t seem to detract from the overall mood of the game due to excellent level design and monster placement. It plays a lot like the original Doom, with monsters popping out of the walls and lurking just around the next corner. This does result in some situations where the monsters are taking cheap shots at your back, but it encourages you to proceed with caution, and it certainly keeps your reflexes honed.\r\n\r\nI\'ve run across a forum posting on <a href=\"http://www.beyond3d.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=14874&amp;start=0&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=&amp;sid=8e4b949674eece27dee4c51b4770efff%E2%80%9D\">boosting Doom 3 performance on ATI cards</a>, written by one of the developers at ATI.

Judis has an eye-opening article up on <em>Foreign Policy</em>. <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=2582&amp;page=0\">Imperial Amnesia</a> draws parallels between the current neoconservative attempts to dominate and transform Iraq, and the late 19th-/early 20th-century imperialist attempts to dominate and transform the Philippines and Mexico. Both Presidents Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt initially set out with goals of changing the world order through American imperialism, and discovered that it simply wouldn\'t work. The parallels are striking, and the repeat of history is a compelling argument against what the Bush administration is attempting right now in the Middle East.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWilson eventually concluded that the United States could not transform the world through imperial aggression. Despite its size and power, America simply could not run the entire globe through military and economic dominance. Instead, Wilson proposed using America\'s power to dismantle the global imperial infrastructure, promoting self-rule worldwide. His ideas were met with acceptance by many nations, and they are still relevant to modern global politics.\r\n\r\nThe United States cannot afford to be in the business of taking over other sovereign nations and refusing to give them up until their people settle on a government we find agreeable. It always results in resentment and revolution, and a massive toll on the economies and lives of both the smaller country and the United States. Imperialism didn\'t work in the Philippines in the 1890s or Mexico in 1913, failed miserably in Cuba and Vietnam during the Cold War, and continues to flail about in Afghanistan and Iraq to this day.\r\n\r\nInstead of attempting to pacify the world one nation at a time, the United States must devote its resources to removing the imperial legacy built during the 18th and 19th centuries. We should be persuading imperial powers to give up their holdings. We should stamp out business practices that create a stranglehold on the economies of smaller nations and replace such one-sided economic imperialism with real fair trade. We should allow nations to come to democratic rule on their own terms, in their own time. We should intervene with military force where necessary to prevent atrocities, as in the Balkans and Somalia, but such intervention must be multilateral, agreed upon by the entire global community.\r\n\r\nThe lessons learned in the Philippines and Mexico are hardly a hundred years in the past, and yet policy-makers have already forgotten them. Imperialism is an obvious root cause of many world problems. Dabbling in imperialism simply is not an option, not when so many already despise the United States. If we are to be a beacon of reason and sanity in the world, we must stop acting irresponsibly and become a model democratic and free society. Removing imperialism from our foreign policy would go a long way toward convincing the world that we\'re serious about this whole liberty and justice thing.','Those who do not learn from history',0,'','publish','open','open','','those-who-do-not-learn-from-history','','','2008-04-03 16:59:39','2008-04-03 23:59:39','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/2004/09/13/those-who-do-not-learn-from-history/',0,'post','',0),(330,2,'2004-10-13 15:59:02','2004-10-13 22:59:02','I just recently started playing <a href=\"http://www.secondlife.com/\">Second Life</a>, a massive online world in which the players themselves create most of the content. It\'s amazingly addictive, and brings to mind happy memories of playing a character in the text-based online world, <a href=\"http://www.lambdamoo.info/\">LambdaMOO</a>.\r\n\r\nOne of the issues that often comes up in online worlds is that of gender. An online environment places no restriction on the gender portrayed in-world, so players are free to play the opposite gender. On his journalistic blog about Second Life, Wagner James Au posted some <a href=\"http://secondlife.blogs.com/nwn/2004/06/instant_reflect.html\">insights on sex and race</a> that he received from another player, and that posting sparked a lively conversation in the blog\'s comments section.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\nI\'ve been playing female avatars in online games for years, from the early days of text-only character descriptions to the current crop of modern, 3D-rendered avatars. It started out as a social experiment; given no information about a person\'s gender other than what I supplied in the avatar\'s description, how would I be treated? And though I suspected it might be the case, I was <em>shocked</em> at how differently I was treated in-game when presenting a female avatar than when I wore a male guise. I\'ve since discussed my experiences many times with female friends, who sadly relate that much of the harassment I received from overly-amorous males in game is not much different from their experiences in the real world.\r\n\r\nThere are those playing online games who have a hard time letting go of their real-world identity; they can\'t make the logical jump that an online environment is <em>fantasy</em>, and that it is merely an extension of the real world. I suspect that many players with this problem lack maturity; this is most likely due to young age, common in many combat-oriented online games, like <a href=\"http://www.everquest.com/\">EverQuest</a> or <a href=\"http://www.cityofheroes.com/\">City of Heroes</a>. Second Life enforces an over 18 age policy, so the couple of times I\'ve encountered this lack of maturity it\'s likely to be simple personality defect, or perhaps someone using daddy\'s credit card (or Second Life account) to log on.\r\n\r\nThere is great power in being able to discard the baggage associated with one\'s real-world gender, ethnicity, age, nationality, sexual preference, economic status, social class, occupation, or any other major attribute we use to categorize other human beings. Playing in a game where the people you meet are defined entirely by what they reveal in-game is a mind-expanding experience; it really makes you think long and hard about how little we pay attention to each other as individuals, and more as members of certain categories. Perhaps if more people were to experience an environment in which true equality is possible, they would be less likely to dehumanize people, treating others as individuals rather than stereotypes.\r\n\r\nAside from the social experiment aspect of playing a female character, I also find it an interesting challenge. I\'ve enjoyed roleplaying games for years, and I like to think that I\'m not half bad at defining the parameters of a character and acting within that role. It\'s very rewarding for me to maintain the illusion of femininity in-game, simply for the difficulty I must overcome in watching every word I say and every action I perform to make sure they\'re in-character. It\'s no different than the difficulty I\'d have playing an orc, a blind martial artist, or a man who can fly and throw lightning from his fingertips (all roles that I\'ve played at one point or another).\r\n\r\nThe key to convincingly playing a role (cross-gender or otherwise) is finding those parts of yourself that you can extend into the performance. There\'s always some aspect of me in each character, sometimes a part of myself that I wouldn\'t even be aware of if I weren\'t trying to act out a role. Those bits that aren\'t present within you (green skin, blind fighting prowess, superpowers) can then be built on top of a template that contains elements you are familiar with. It\'s both self-expression and introspection at the same time.\r\n\r\nSecond Life has picked up where text-based online worlds left off, providing a fantastic environment for deep roleplaying. I realize that not everyone is interested in putting in the effort required, and I don\'t mind that many people come to online worlds simply to chat while wearing an avatar. I\'ve learned over the years to politely refuse the requests for real-world gender and age. Typically, people who are obsessed about these attributes of my real life aren\'t much fun to interact with in-game, anyhow; many lack imagination, and more often than not, want to use the game as some kind of dating service. But those other players who are willing to set aside their real-world persona, even for a little while, make it all worthwhile to me.','Gender portrayal in online worlds',0,'','publish','open','open','','gender-portrayal-in-online-worlds','','','2008-04-03 16:50:51','2008-04-03 23:50:51','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/2004/10/13/gender-portrayal-in-online-worlds/',0,'post','',0),(331,2,'2004-10-28 09:22:28','2004-10-28 16:22:28','What happens when you combine the Mythos tales of H.

I can fully identify with this problem. I don\'t actually use Emacs itself for everything, but nonetheless, I irrationally expect applications to adhere to its arcane system of strange key bindings.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to open a program with a text-editing interface and not get three new documents when I press Ctrl+N a few times to move the cursor down a few rows. Selecting the entire text of a document when I\'m attempting to move to the beginning of a line with Ctrl+A would be helpful, as well. Alas, I\'ve managed to find ways to lobotomize even the most recalcitrant of Windows applications into using Emacs key bindings, largely through a clever program called <a href=\"http://www.cam.hi-ho.ne.jp/oishi/indexen.html\">XKeymacs</a>. Thanks to this little utility, even Microsoft Word behaves like Emacs most of the time.\r\n\r\nOf course, as I\'ve typed this, I\'ve used Ctrl+B several times to move the cursor back and insert a word, then Ctrl+E to skip to the end of the line again and resume typing, a pattern that is so etched into my motor memory that it will likely never fade away. Computers will be voice-controlled in the future, and yet my fingers will still twitch over familiar key bindings, even as I dictate aloud to a low-sapient AI who is already anticipating my needs and inserting those words I\'ve forgotten.','Emacs makes you retarded',0,'','publish','open','open','','emacs-makes-you-retarded','','','2008-04-03 00:03:04','2008-04-03 07:03:04','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/2005/09/17/emacs-makes-you-retarded/',0,'post','',1),(355,2,'2005-09-17 10:40:47','2005-09-17 17:40:47','Some of the most clever paper engineering I\'ve seen has resulted in the transformation of a pair of Paris MÃ©tro tickets into an itty bitty X-wing fighter. <a href=\"http://www.cfsl.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=22455\">X-wing en tickets de mÃ©tro step by step</a> contains all the instructions you need to convert your MÃ©tro tickets into the premier starfighter of the Rebel Alliance.','Paris M&eacute;tro X-wing',0,'','publish','open','open','','paris-mtro-x-wing','','','2008-04-03 00:00:33','2008-04-03 07:00:33','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/2005/09/17/paris-mtro-x-wing/',0,'post','',0),(356,2,'2005-09-21 11:44:40','2005-09-21 18:44:40','Amidst the uproar and ridicule over the wacky new controller design for the Nintendo Revolution, it\'s great to see some more level-headed commentary on what Nintendo might be trying to accomplish. <a href=\"http://lostgarden.com/2005/09/nintendos-genre-innovation-strategy.html\">Nintendo\'s Genre Innovation Strategy: Thoughts on the Revolution\'s new controller</a> is an insightful article about how Nintendo has positioned itself as an innovation leader in the gaming marketplace, reaping the benefits of releasing not the most polished games for the most hardcore gamers, but the newest technological and gameplay advances for a wider audience.

There\'s something deeply appealing to my inner nerd about having Unix on my phone, and recreational command line hacking is more fun for me than many of the games available for iPhone.\r\n\r\nThe one thing missing on my journey to mobile nerdvana was \"zsh\":http://www.zsh.org, my favorite shell. Cydia had a zsh package available as soon as Pwnage Tool 2.0 came out, and I promptly installed it. Unfortunately, though I was able to run zsh from the command line, I couldn\'t figure out how to set it as the default login shell.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWell, a bit of googling later, and I found out that on the iPhone (and possibly Mac OS X, whence iPhone derives much of its unixy goodness) editing @/etc/passwd@ won\'t do the trick. In fact, there\'s a big fat comment at the head of @/etc/passwd@ that informs you that editing it won\'t be particularly useful:\r\n\r\n<textarea readonly=\"readonly\" wrap=\"off\" style=\"width: 100%; font-family: Monaco, \'Courier New\', Courier, monospace; font-size: 85%;\">\r\n # Note that this file is not consulted for login.\r\n # It only exisits for compatability with 4.3BSD utilities.</textarea>\r\n\r\nHow then to set up default shells?

It\'s understandable that they would prefer people to use Adobe Acrobat or InDesign for this purpose, and it may be argued that those are much better tools for the job. However, when the only tool you have is Illustrator, it\'s not nearly that simple.\n\nThis is a topic that\'s been covered \"elsewhere\":http://www.lifeclever.com/how-to-create-multi-page-pdfs-in-illustrator-cs2/, but never with all the pieces in one place where I can easily find them. Small wonder, then, that I\'ve only recently been able to get this working. These simple instructions work great for most Illustrator files, but I recently needed to make some brochures that have bleeds. With most printer drivers, Illustrator insists on trimming the edges of a multi-page PDF to fit within the printable area allowed by the printer.

This was my primary stumbling block; the Lexpro I normally print to at work is a pretty basic black and white laser printer, and it doesn\'t print to the edges.\n\nFortunately, Adobe has a generic PostScript Printer Description (PPD) file available for download. A PPD normally describes what capabilities a PostScript printer has. The generic PPD lacks the usual printable area that restricts most printers to use only part of the page, and thus it\'s useful for generating PDF files with bleeds.\n\nThe Windows \n\nhttp://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/product.jsp?product=44&platform=Windows\nIn Windows Illustrator, printer appears as Adobe PDF\nhttp://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=204\n\n\nMac:\nhttp://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=141\nPostScript Printer Description file','Multiple page PDF from Illustrator',0,'','inherit','open','open','','392-revision-7','','','2008-08-12 18:44:54','2008-08-13 01:44:54','',392,'http://blog.nyerm.com/2008/08/12/392-revision-7/',0,'revision','',0),(424,2,'2008-08-17 12:24:45','2008-08-17 19:24:45','Jott is a mind boggling cool technology.

I don\'t use the embedded WYSIWIG editor widget in Wordpress, preferring to format my posts with \"Textile\":http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/ so I can just keep typing instead of trying to figure out what all the little buttons are supposed to do. TextMate does a great job with highlighting Textile, providing just enough coloring and styling to let you know that you\'re doing the markup right without getting in the way of the writing.\n\nOn top of that, I\'ve got the security of knowing that my prose isn\'t going to disappear if the browser crashes or my network connection flakes out. Need more time to compose a lengthy article? Just save it locally, as a simple text file, and come back to it later. This is the very definition of \"no muss, no fuss.\"\n\nNow to see if this bundle works as well in TextMate\'s Windows cousin, \"e\":http://www.e-texteditor.com/, so I can get the same great feature on my laptop that I have on the iMac at work.\n\n*UPDATE (2009-02-11 21:03):* Yes, indeed, this same power exists in e.

Instead of having weird routes like @/sections/1@, I want human-readable URLs like @/about@. They look nicer, and they\'re better for SEO(search engine optimization).\n\n<!--more-->\n\nh3. To the rescue: dynamic named routes\n\nTo create the pretty section names, my routing dynamically creates a set of named routes based on the URL-friendly string stored in each Section\'s @name@ attribute. The appropriate part of @routes.db@ looks like this:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  map.resources :sections\n  Section.find(:all).each do |section|\n    map.named_route(\"#{section.name}_section\",\n                    section.name,\n                    :controller => \'sections\',\n                    :action => \'show\',\n                    :id => section.name,\n                    :method => :get)\n  end\n</pre>\n\nThe first thing this code does is create normal RESTful routes for the sections:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  map.resources :sections\n</pre>\n\nCreating the usual RESTful routes allows administrative actions, like editing and deleting sections, to have all the benefits of regular REST routing. I can still edit a section at @/sections/1/edit@, or delete one by sending the DELETE HTTP method to @/sections/1@. I\'m okay with most of these URLs showing off section ID numbers, because they\'re all tucked away behind an admin interface that requires authentication to access. What I really need is to create new routes for each section\'s @show@ action, which is what the next part of the code does.\n\nNext, the code iterates over the sections in the database, using the standard ActiveRecord find method:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nogutter:nocontrols\">\n  Section.find(:all).each do |section|\n</pre>\n\nWithin this @each@ block, the @map.named_route@ method is used to create a named route pointing to each section\'s @show@ method. Normally, Rails creates named routes using a little @method_missing@ magic. This is great when you\'re making a named route by hand; it lets you create named routes on the fly, instead of having to call a method on the @map@ object (an instance of @ActionController::Routing::RouteSet::Mapper@). Unfortunately, this bit of syntactic sugar isn\'t as nice to code that needs to create named routes.\n\nFortunately, the @Mapper@ class contains an undocumented @named_route@ method that creates named routes in a standard method call, rather than relying on @method_missing@ to fill in the blanks. The @named_route@ method takes three arguments: the name for the new route, the URL path that will trigger the route, and a hash full of options defining the properties of the route. In my case, the name for the route is composed of the Section object\'s @name@ attribute, with @_section@ tacked onto the end. This results in helper methods like @about_section_path@ and @faq_section_url@. The recognized path is the name of the section itself, meaning that @/about@ will go straight to the section controller\'s @show@ method and display the About page.\n\nh3. Putting in the human-readable bit\n\nOne other sneaky thing I\'m doing is on line 7 of the first code example, with @:id => section.name@. Because I\'m using short, human-readable names in my section URLs, I\'ve changed how the Section model generates URLs. By default, ActiveRecord returns the record\'s @id@ as a String, resulting in the familiar @/sections/1@ style of URL. However, if you override the @to_param@ method of an ActiveRecord model, you can change how it generates URLs. Over in my @section.rb@ file, I have the following code:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nogutter:nocontrols\">\n  def to_param\n    name\n  end\n</pre>\n\nThis ensures that when the Section model is used to generate a URL, it returns the friendly, human-readable @name@ attribute instead of its numeric @id@.\n\nh3. A drawback: rake gets wonky\n\nThere is a downside to this method of dynamically generating routes. Recent Rails versions (probably 2.1 and later) changed the rake tasks framework to load up the entire application\'s environment before running any rake task. Unfortunately, this includes the @routes.rb@ file. Because my routing queries the database, a normally innocuous invocation of @rake db:create@ causes problems if the database is missing or empty, producing an error like the following:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"sql:nogutter:nocontrols\">\n  > rake db:create\n  rake aborted!\n  Unknown database \'project_development\'\n</pre>\n\nI can\'t fathom why something like @db:create@ would need access to the application\'s entire environment, and it\'s particularly silly in this case that in order to create the database, there must already be a database. I expect that purists would argue that having a database query in my routing breaks MVC(model view controller) separation, but this method makes it simple to make named routes based on changeable data. The workaround is to comment out the @Section.find@ part of the @routes.rb@ file before running things like @db:create@, but it\'s a poor workaround, indeed.\n\nIn addition, I\'m not positive that this setup works well under the Rails production environment. It\'s been fine in development, but caching and other goodness introduced in a production application could mean that I can\'t change the routing on the fly like this, instead requiring the application to restart to pick up any changes to the sections data. I recall earlier versions of Rails requiring a restart any time routing was changed, but I haven\'t been able to track down if this applies to 2.2 in production.\n\nh3. A different approach?\n\nAnother possibility, which I may settle on eventually, would be to add a catch-all route at the bottom of @routes.rb@ that pipes everything through a dispatch method in the sections controller. It might look something like this:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nogutter:nocontrols\">\n  map.parse_section \':section\',\n    :controller => \'sections\',\n    :action => \'parse\'\n</pre>\n\nIt could perform the database lookup inside controller code and compare it to the string captured by the routing system, and it wouldn\'t interfere with rake tasks. It\'s important to note that this route should be at the very bottom of @routes.db@, else it will slurp up any single-component URL and attempt to process it with the section @parse@ method.','Dynamic human-readable RESTful routing',0,'','publish','open','open','','dynamic-human-readable-restful-routing','','','2009-02-20 04:13:39','2009-02-20 11:13:39','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/?p=483',0,'post','',1),(484,2,'2009-02-16 20:02:45','2009-02-17 03:02:45','I\'m slowly becoming a convert to the RESTful routing model in recent versions of Rails, largely because it builds a pile of useful named routes with a tiny amount of code.

A drawback: rake gets wonky\n\nThere is a downside to this method of dynamically generating routes. Recent Rails versions (probably 2.1 and later) changed the rake tasks framework to load up the entire application\'s environment before running any rake task. Unfortunately, this includes the @routes.rb@ file. Because my routing queries the database, a normally innocuous invocation of @rake db:create@ causes problems if the database is missing or empty, producing an error like the following:\n\n[sourcecode language=\'sql\']> rake db:create\nrake aborted!\nUnknown database \'project_development\'[/sourcecode]\n\nI can\'t fathom why something like @db:create@ would need access to the application\'s entire environment, and it\'s particularly silly in this case that in order to create the database, there must already be a database. I expect that purists would argue that having a database query in my routing breaks MVC(model view controller) separation, but this method makes it simple to make named routes based on changeable data. The workaround is to comment out the @Section.find@ part of the @routes.rb@ file before running things like @db:create@, but it\'s a poor workaround, indeed.\n\nIn addition, I\'m not positive that this setup works well under the Rails production environment. It\'s been fine in development, but caching and other goodness introduced in a production application could mean that I can\'t change the routing on the fly like this, instead requiring the application to restart to pick up any changes to the sections data. I recall earlier versions of Rails requiring a restart any time routing was changed, but I haven\'t been able to track down if this applies to 2.2 in production.\n\nh3. A different approach?\n\nAnother possibility, which I may settle on eventually, would be to add a catch-all route at the bottom of @routes.rb@ that pipes everything through a dispatch method in the sections controller. It might look something like this:\n\n[sourcecode language=\'ruby\']map.parse_section \':section\',\n  :controller => \'sections\',\n  :action => \'parse\'[/sourcecode]\n\nIt could perform the database lookup inside controller code and compare it to the string captured by the routing system, and it wouldn\'t interfere with rake tasks.

None of the bookmark sidebar links worked, nor any table of contents links, nor any other hyperlinks anywhere in the book, but at least InDesign decided to stay with me this time instead of unceremoniously quitting.\n\nOn the theory that a logical approach wasn\'t working, I started poking at random settings. I got lucky with the first one I tried; turning off *Create Tagged PDF* not only prevented InDesign from crashing, it produced a fully functional PDF with working bookmarks and hyperlinks. Mission accomplished!\n\nI\'m a bit frustrated that InDesign refuses to make a tagged PDF with working hyperlinks. The whole point to tagged PDFs is that they define document structure, which makes them accessible to assistive reading technologies and lets mobile devices reflow the content to better fit tiny screens. This book isn\'t likely to reach a huge audience to begin with, but it hurts to think that InDesign might be shrinking that audience even further.

If I put @map.resources :sections@ in my @routes.db@ file, I instantly get @sections_path@, @edit_section_path@, and all their friends. When coding a controller, it\'s a lot nicer to write @redirect_to section_path@ than @redirect_to :controller => :section, :action => show@.\n\nThe only difficulty I have with default routes created by @map.resources@ is that, in some cases, they\'re ugly and show too much of the application\'s internal workings. For example, the application I\'m working on now has a Section model, which describes a major section heading in the site (things like About, FAQ, and Help). Instead of having weird routes like @/sections/1@, I want human-readable URLs like @/about@. They look nicer, and they\'re better for SEO(search engine optimization).\n\n<!--more-->\n\nh3. To the rescue: dynamic named routes\n\nTo create the pretty section names, my routing dynamically creates a set of named routes based on the URL-friendly string stored in each Section\'s @name@ attribute. The appropriate part of @routes.db@ looks like this:\n\n[sourcecode language=\'ruby\']map.resources :sections\nSection.find(:all).each do |section|\n  map.named_route(\"#{section.name}_section\",\n                  section.name,\n                  :controller => \'sections\',\n                  :action => \'show\',\n                  :id => section.name,\n                  :method => :get)\nend[/sourcecode]\n\nThe first thing this code does is create normal RESTful routes for the sections:\n\n[sourcecode language=\'ruby\']map.resources :sections[/sourcecode]\n\nCreating the usual RESTful routes allows administrative actions, like editing and deleting sections, to have all the benefits of regular REST routing. I can still edit a section at @/sections/1/edit@, or delete one by sending the DELETE HTTP method to @/sections/1@. I\'m okay with most of these URLs showing off section ID numbers, because they\'re all tucked away behind an admin interface that requires authentication to access. What I really need is to create new routes for each section\'s @show@ action, which is what the next part of the code does.\n\nNext, the code iterates over the sections in the database, using the standard ActiveRecord find method:\n\n[sourcecode language=\'ruby\']Section.find(:all).each do |section|[/sourcecode]\n\nWithin this @each@ block, the @map.named_route@ method is used to create a named route pointing to each section\'s @show@ method. Normally, Rails creates named routes using a little @method_missing@ magic. This is great when you\'re making a named route by hand; it lets you create named routes on the fly, instead of having to call a method on the @map@ object (an instance of @ActionController::Routing::RouteSet::Mapper@). Unfortunately, this bit of syntactic sugar isn\'t as nice to code that needs to create named routes.\n\nFortunately, the @Mapper@ class contains an undocumented @named_route@ method that creates named routes in a standard method call, rather than relying on @method_missing@ to fill in the blanks. The @named_route@ method takes three arguments: the name for the new route, the URL path that will trigger the route, and a hash full of options defining the properties of the route. In my case, the name for the route is composed of the Section object\'s @name@ attribute, with @_section@ tacked onto the end. This results in helper methods like @about_section_path@ and @faq_section_url@. The recognized path is the name of the section itself, meaning that @/about@ will go straight to the section controller\'s @show@ method and display the About page.\n\nh3. Putting in the human-readable bit\n\nOne other sneaky thing I\'m doing is on line 7 of the first code example, with @:id => section.name@. Because I\'m using short, human-readable names in my section URLs, I\'ve changed how the Section model generates URLs. By default, ActiveRecord returns the record\'s @id@ as a String, resulting in the familiar @/sections/1@ style of URL. However, if you override the @to_param@ method of an ActiveRecord model, you can change how it generates URLs. Over in my @section.rb@ file, I have the following code:\n\n[sourcecode language=\'ruby\']def to_param\n  name\nend[/sourcecode]\n\nThis ensures that when the Section model is used to generate a URL, it returns the friendly, human-readable @name@ attribute instead of its numeric @id@.\n\nh3. A drawback: rake gets wonky\n\nThere is a downside to this method of dynamically generating routes. Recent Rails versions (probably 2.1 and later) changed the rake tasks framework to load up the entire application\'s environment before running any rake task. Unfortunately, this includes the @routes.rb@ file. Because my routing queries the database, a normally innocuous invocation of @rake db:create@ causes problems if the database is missing or empty, producing an error like the following:\n\n[sourcecode language=\'sql\']> rake db:create\nrake aborted!\nUnknown database \'project_development\'[/sourcecode]\n\nI can\'t fathom why something like @db:create@ would need access to the application\'s entire environment, and it\'s particularly silly in this case that in order to create the database, there must already be a database. I expect that purists would argue that having a database query in my routing breaks MVC(model view controller) separation, but this method makes it simple to make named routes based on changeable data. The workaround is to comment out the @Section.find@ part of the @routes.rb@ file before running things like @db:create@, but it\'s a poor workaround, indeed.\n\nIn addition, I\'m not positive that this setup works well under the Rails production environment. It\'s been fine in development, but caching and other goodness introduced in a production application could mean that I can\'t change the routing on the fly like this, instead requiring the application to restart to pick up any changes to the sections data. I recall earlier versions of Rails requiring a restart any time routing was changed, but I haven\'t been able to track down if this applies to 2.2 in production.\n\nh3. A different approach?\n\nAnother possibility, which I may settle on eventually, would be to add a catch-all route at the bottom of @routes.rb@ that pipes everything through a dispatch method in the sections controller. It might look something like this:\n\n[sourcecode language=\'ruby\']map.parse_section \':section\',\n  :controller => \'sections\',\n  :action => \'parse\'[/sourcecode]\n\nIt could perform the database lookup inside controller code and compare it to the string captured by the routing system, and it wouldn\'t interfere with rake tasks. It\'s important to note that this route should be at the very bottom of @routes.db@, else it will slurp up any single-component URL and attempt to process it with the section @parse@ method.','Dynamic human-readable RESTful routing',0,'','inherit','open','open','','483-revision-19','','','2009-02-16 23:42:45','2009-02-17 06:42:45','',483,'http://blog.nyerm.com/2009/02/16/483-revision-19/',0,'revision','',0),(540,2,'2009-02-27 01:12:20','2009-02-27 08:12:20','','The Typography Desk Reference',0,'','draft','open','open','','','','','2009-02-27 01:12:20','2009-02-27 08:12:20','',0,'http://blog.nyerm.com/?p=540',0,'post','',0),(541,2,'2009-03-06 04:38:03','2009-03-06 11:38:03','The \"Helipad Ruby interface\":http://nyerm.com/helipad is \"now available on GitHub\":http://github.com/lonnon/helipad in addition to its original home on \"RubyForge\":http://rubyforge.org/projects/helipad.\n\nThere\'s no difference at all between the two, apart from the GitHub copy bearing my name, which is GitHub\'s convention for preventing collision between identically-named gems.

So I fired up Google and a text editor and started hacking away.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nh3. Enter Sinatra\n\nThe most pleasant part of this whole experience was picking up \"Sinatra\":http://sinatrarb.com, a minimal Ruby web framework that hearkens back to the simpler days of shoving a bunch of Perl into a CGI script and calling it a day. Like the CGI script of yore, you can easily stuff a small app into a single file. Unlike that CGI script, Sinatra lends itself well to MVC(Model View Controller) separation, test- or spec-driven development, and other modern programming conveniences. It\'s ideal for slapping a quick user interface on some Ruby code.\n\nSinatra\'s \"readme\":http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html is a great drink-from-the-fire-hose introduction to what the framework can do, but the minimal \"hello world\" application on Sinatra\'s home page is a bit _too_ minimal to be instructive. There are some great tutorials listed on the Sinatra site, though. In particular, I found \"Building an iPhone web app in under 50 lines with Sinatra and iUI\":http://devver.net/blog/2008/11/building-a-iphone-web-app-in-under-50-lines-with-sinatra-and-iui/ to be just the ticket for quickly getting up to speed on what Sinatra does. As an added bonus, it\'s got iPhone stuff in it, which is worth at least two squares in Buzzword Bingo.\n\nh3. Dreamhost, prepare to be boarded\n\nThe first step is to make a domain in the Dreamhost panel and configure it to run Passenger. From what I\'ve been reading, Passenger isn\'t really set up to run apps in a subdirectory (like @example.com/myapp@), so a new subdomain is the way to go here (like @myapp.example.com@). Dreamhost lets you define as many subdomains as you want, so this isn\'t a problem; just click *Add New Domain / Sub-Domain* in the *Domains* > *Manage Domains* screen.\n\n!http://blog.nyerm.com/images/dh-manage-domains.png!\n\nOn the Fully Hosted page that appears, check the *Ruby on Rails Passenger* box. Then set up the web directory as you would for any other site, but add @current/public@ to the end of the path. We\'re using Capistrano to deploy the app, and Capistrano wants to deploy to a directory called @current@. Passenger expects the web directory to point to the app\'s @public@ folder. Combining those two makes a path ending in @current/public@.\n\n!http://blog.nyerm.com/images/dh-fully-hosted.png!\n\nLet Dreamhost do its thing and create the new domain. Depending on how flaky its systems are and the current phase of the moon, you may have a working subdomain in a few minutes or several hours. I failed my saving throw versus Broken Scripts and got the several hours version when I set up the domain yesterday, resulting in the dreaded @bad_httpd_conf@ error. You can sometimes force Dreamhost to rebuild your messed up httpd configuration by going back to the Fully Hosted page and just clicking the *Fully host this domain now* button. No need to change any settings on the page; apparently, performing this little ritual will kick the scripts into gear, and with luck, you\'ll have a working subdomain with Passenger running on it.\n\nWhen Dreamhost\'s scripts get around to creating the domain, they\'ll also create its web directory. You\'ll need to ssh over to your account and delete the @current@ directory that\'s there. Capistrano recreates @current@ as a symbolic link pointing to the currently deployed version of the application.\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  > cd ~/sites/sinatra-test.nyerm.com\n  > rm -rf current\n</pre>\n\nh3. Vendoring Sinatra and Rack\n\nThough it\'s possible to get your own local gem repository working on Dreamhost (and for some gems, like RMagick, necessary), I find it simpler to unpack gems required by the app into a @vendor@ folder and just deploy them with the rest of the application.\n\nAs I write this, Dreamhost doesn\'t have Sinatra installed at all, and its copy of Rack is version 0.4.0, which is incompatible with the latest Sinatra (0.9.1.1). So, I unpacked both of these gems into a @vendor@ folder. Run these commands from the root of your Sinatra project:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  > mkdir vendor\n  > cd vendor\n  > gem unpack rack\n  > gem mv rack* rack\n  > gem unpack sinatra\n  > gem mv sinatra* sinatra\n</pre>\n\nBe sure to change the @require \'sinatra\'@ line at the start of your application so it requires the vendor copy of Sinatra:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  require \'vendor/sinatra/lib/sinatra\'\n</pre>\n\nh3. Capifying and racking\n\nWith Dreamhost ready to receive your application, it\'s time to get Capistrano in on the action. First you\'ll need to create a @Capfile@ so Capistrano knows where your application\'s source is and where it should be deployed.\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  > capify .\n</pre>\n\nOpen @Capfile@ in your favorite editor and replace the sparse default contents of the file with something more like this:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  load \'deploy\' if respond_to?(:namespace)\n\n  default_run_options[:pty] = true\n  \n  # be sure to change these\n  set :user, \'username\'\n  set :domain, \'domain.com\'\n  set :application, \'myapp\'\n  \n  # the rest should be good\n  set :repository,\n      \"#{user}@#{domain}:git/#{application}.git\"\n  set :deploy_to,\n      \"/home/#{user}/#{application}.#{domain}\"\n  set :deploy_via, :remote_cache\n  set :scm, \'git\'\n  set :branch, \'master\'\n  set :git_shallow_clone, 1\n  set :scm_verbose, true\n  set :use_sudo, false\n  \n  server domain, :app, :web\n  \n  namespace :deploy do\n    task :restart do\n      run \"touch #{current_path}/tmp/restart.txt\" \n    end\n  end\n</pre>\n\nI found a number of sites with reasonable instructions for deploying Sinatra to Dreamhost, and my favorite is \"John Nunemaker\'s guide on RailsTips\":http://railstips.org/2008/12/15/deploying-sinatra-on-dreamhost-with-passenger. The @Capfile@ above is from his article, which is well worth a look.\n\nThe bits that you might need to change in the @Capfile@ here, aside from the obvious @:user@, @:domain@, and @:application@ fill-ins, are the @:repository@ and @:deploy_to@ paths. For example, I keep my personal Git repository in a directory that\'s served out by Apache so I can browse the contents. Also, my file structure has an extra @sites@ directory above the web roots, because I don\'t like the mess that Dreamhost\'s default paths make of my home directory. The appropriate portion of my @Capfile@ looks like this:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  set :repository,\n    \"#{user}@#{domain}:sites/git.nyerm.com/#{application}.git\"\n  set :deploy_to,\n    \"/home/#{user}/sites/#{application}.#{domain}\"\n</pre>\n\nThe last ingredient needed for deployment to Dreamhost is a rackup configuration file, @config.ru@. Pop open the text editor again and enter the following:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  require \'vendor/rack/lib/rack\'\n  require \'vendor/sinatra/lib/sinatra\'\n  \n  set :run, false\n  set :environment, :production\n  set :views, \"views\"\n  \n  require \'hi.rb\'\n  run Sinatra::Application\n</pre>\n\nh3. Deploying to Dreamhost\n\nCheck all your files in and push to the remote Git repository, and you should be ready to deploy with the following commands:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  > cap deploy:setup\n  > cap deploy\n</pre>\n\nAssuming you don\'t have any typos and Dreamhost is choosing to be merciful, you should now have a Sinatra app running on Dreamhost. On the other hand, if like me you\'re not a divine being of pure logic, you might want to enable Rack\'s logging middleware so you have some clue what\'s not working. Stick the following in your @config.ru@, and you\'ll get something more useful than you\'ll find in the Apache logs:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  log = File.new(\"log/sinatra.log\", \"w\")\n  STDOUT.reopen(log)\n  STDERR.reopen(log)\n</pre>\n\nh3.

Vendoring Sinatra and Rack\n\nThough it\'s possible to get your own local gem repository working on Dreamhost (and for some gems, like RMagick, necessary), I find it simpler to unpack gems required by the app into a @vendor@ folder and just deploy them with the rest of the application.\n\nAs I write this, Dreamhost doesn\'t have Sinatra installed at all, and its copy of Rack is version 0.4.0, which is incompatible with the latest Sinatra (0.9.1.1). So, I unpacked both of these gems into a @vendor@ folder. Run these commands from the root of your Sinatra project:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"sh:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  > mkdir vendor\n  > cd vendor\n  > gem unpack rack\n  > gem mv rack* rack\n  > gem unpack sinatra\n  > gem mv sinatra* sinatra\n</pre>\n\nBe sure to change the @require \'sinatra\'@ line at the start of your application so it requires the vendor copy of Sinatra:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  require \'vendor/sinatra/lib/sinatra\'\n</pre>\n\nh3. Capifying and racking\n\nWith Dreamhost ready to receive your application, it\'s time to get Capistrano in on the action. First you\'ll need to create a @Capfile@ so Capistrano knows where your application\'s source is and where it should be deployed.\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"sh:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  > capify .\n</pre>\n\nOpen @Capfile@ in your favorite editor and replace the sparse default contents of the file with something more like this:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  load \'deploy\' if respond_to?(:namespace)\n\n  default_run_options[:pty] = true\n  \n  # be sure to change these\n  set :user, \'username\'\n  set :domain, \'domain.com\'\n  set :application, \'myapp\'\n  \n  # the rest should be good\n  set :repository,\n      \"#{user}@#{domain}:git/#{application}.git\"\n  set :deploy_to,\n      \"/home/#{user}/#{application}.#{domain}\"\n  set :deploy_via, :remote_cache\n  set :scm, \'git\'\n  set :branch, \'master\'\n  set :git_shallow_clone, 1\n  set :scm_verbose, true\n  set :use_sudo, false\n  \n  server domain, :app, :web\n  \n  namespace :deploy do\n    task :restart do\n      run \"touch #{current_path}/tmp/restart.txt\" \n    end\n  end\n</pre>\n\nI found a number of sites with reasonable instructions for deploying Sinatra to Dreamhost, and my favorite is \"John Nunemaker\'s guide on RailsTips\":http://railstips.org/2008/12/15/deploying-sinatra-on-dreamhost-with-passenger. The @Capfile@ above is from his article, which is well worth a look.\n\nThe bits that you might need to change in the @Capfile@ here, aside from the obvious @:user@, @:domain@, and @:application@ fill-ins, are the @:repository@ and @:deploy_to@ paths. For example, I keep my personal Git repository in a directory that\'s served out by Apache so I can browse the contents. Also, my file structure has an extra @sites@ directory above the web roots, because I don\'t like the mess that Dreamhost\'s default paths make of my home directory. The appropriate portion of my @Capfile@ looks like this:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  set :repository,\n    \"#{user}@#{domain}:sites/git.nyerm.com/#{application}.git\"\n  set :deploy_to,\n    \"/home/#{user}/sites/#{application}.#{domain}\"\n</pre>\n\nThe last ingredient needed for deployment to Dreamhost is a rackup configuration file, @config.ru@. Pop open the text editor again and enter the following:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  require \'vendor/rack/lib/rack\'\n  require \'vendor/sinatra/lib/sinatra\'\n  \n  set :run, false\n  set :environment, :production\n  set :views, \"views\"\n  \n  require \'hi.rb\'\n  run Sinatra::Application\n</pre>\n\nh3. Deploying to Dreamhost\n\nCheck all your files in and push to the remote Git repository, and you should be ready to deploy with the following commands:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"sh:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  > cap deploy:setup\n  > cap deploy\n</pre>\n\nAssuming you don\'t have any typos and Dreamhost is choosing to be merciful, you should now have a Sinatra app running on Dreamhost. On the other hand, if like me you\'re not a divine being of pure logic, you might want to enable Rack\'s logging middleware so you have some clue what\'s not working. Stick the following in your @config.ru@, and you\'ll get something more useful than you\'ll find in the Apache logs:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  log = File.new(\"log/sinatra.log\", \"w\")\n  STDOUT.reopen(log)\n  STDERR.reopen(log)\n</pre>\n\nh3.

From what I\'ve been reading, Passenger isn\'t really set up to run apps in a subdirectory (like @example.com/myapp@), so a new subdomain is the way to go here (like @myapp.example.com@). Dreamhost lets you define as many subdomains as you want, so this isn\'t a problem; just click *Add New Domain / Sub-Domain* in the *Domains* > *Manage Domains* screen.\n\n!http://blog.nyerm.com/images/dh-manage-domains.png!\n\nOn the Fully Hosted page that appears, check the *Ruby on Rails Passenger* box. Then set up the web directory as you would for any other site, but add @current/public@ to the end of the path. We\'re using Capistrano to deploy the app, and Capistrano wants to deploy to a directory called @current@. Passenger expects the web directory to point to the app\'s @public@ folder. Combining those two makes a path ending in @current/public@.\n\n!http://blog.nyerm.com/images/dh-fully-hosted.png!\n\nLet Dreamhost do its thing and create the new domain. Depending on how flaky its systems are and the current phase of the moon, you may have a working subdomain in a few minutes or several hours. I failed my saving throw versus Broken Scripts and got the several hours version when I set up the domain yesterday, resulting in the dreaded @bad_httpd_conf@ error. You can sometimes force Dreamhost to rebuild your messed up httpd configuration by going back to the Fully Hosted page and just clicking the *Fully host this domain now* button. No need to change any settings on the page; apparently, performing this little ritual will kick the scripts into gear, and with luck, you\'ll have a working subdomain with Passenger running on it.\n\nWhen Dreamhost\'s scripts get around to creating the domain, they\'ll also create its web directory. You\'ll need to ssh over to your account and delete the @current@ directory that\'s there. Capistrano recreates @current@ as a symbolic link pointing to the currently deployed version of the application.\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"bash:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  > cd ~/sites/sinatra-test.nyerm.com\n  > rm -rf current\n</pre>\n\nh3. Vendoring Sinatra and Rack\n\nThough it\'s possible to get your own local gem repository working on Dreamhost (and for some gems, like RMagick, necessary), I find it simpler to unpack gems required by the app into a @vendor@ folder and just deploy them with the rest of the application.\n\nAs I write this, Dreamhost doesn\'t have Sinatra installed at all, and its copy of Rack is version 0.4.0, which is incompatible with the latest Sinatra (0.9.1.1). So, I unpacked both of these gems into a @vendor@ folder. Run these commands from the root of your Sinatra project:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"bash:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  > mkdir vendor\n  > cd vendor\n  > gem unpack rack\n  > gem mv rack* rack\n  > gem unpack sinatra\n  > gem mv sinatra* sinatra\n</pre>\n\nBe sure to change the @require \'sinatra\'@ line at the start of your application so it requires the vendor copy of Sinatra:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  require \'vendor/sinatra/lib/sinatra\'\n</pre>\n\nh3. Capifying and racking\n\nWith Dreamhost ready to receive your application, it\'s time to get Capistrano in on the action. First you\'ll need to create a @Capfile@ so Capistrano knows where your application\'s source is and where it should be deployed.\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"bash:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  > capify .\n</pre>\n\nOpen @Capfile@ in your favorite editor and replace the sparse default contents of the file with something more like this:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  load \'deploy\' if respond_to?(:namespace)\n\n  default_run_options[:pty] = true\n  \n  # be sure to change these\n  set :user, \'username\'\n  set :domain, \'domain.com\'\n  set :application, \'myapp\'\n  \n  # the rest should be good\n  set :repository,\n      \"#{user}@#{domain}:git/#{application}.git\"\n  set :deploy_to,\n      \"/home/#{user}/#{application}.#{domain}\"\n  set :deploy_via, :remote_cache\n  set :scm, \'git\'\n  set :branch, \'master\'\n  set :git_shallow_clone, 1\n  set :scm_verbose, true\n  set :use_sudo, false\n  \n  server domain, :app, :web\n  \n  namespace :deploy do\n    task :restart do\n      run \"touch #{current_path}/tmp/restart.txt\" \n    end\n  end\n</pre>\n\nI found a number of sites with reasonable instructions for deploying Sinatra to Dreamhost, and my favorite is \"John Nunemaker\'s guide on RailsTips\":http://railstips.org/2008/12/15/deploying-sinatra-on-dreamhost-with-passenger. The @Capfile@ above is from his article, which is well worth a look.\n\nThe bits that you might need to change in the @Capfile@ here, aside from the obvious @:user@, @:domain@, and @:application@ fill-ins, are the @:repository@ and @:deploy_to@ paths. For example, I keep my personal Git repository in a directory that\'s served out by Apache so I can browse the contents. Also, my file structure has an extra @sites@ directory above the web roots, because I don\'t like the mess that Dreamhost\'s default paths make of my home directory. The appropriate portion of my @Capfile@ looks like this:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  set :repository,\n    \"#{user}@#{domain}:sites/git.nyerm.com/#{application}.git\"\n  set :deploy_to,\n    \"/home/#{user}/sites/#{application}.#{domain}\"\n</pre>\n\nThe last ingredient needed for deployment to Dreamhost is a rackup configuration file, @config.ru@. Pop open the text editor again and enter the following:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  require \'vendor/rack/lib/rack\'\n  require \'vendor/sinatra/lib/sinatra\'\n  \n  set :run, false\n  set :environment, :production\n  set :views, \"views\"\n  \n  require \'hi.rb\'\n  run Sinatra::Application\n</pre>\n\nh3.

On the other hand, if like me you\'re not a divine being of pure logic, you might want to enable Rack\'s logging middleware so you have some clue what\'s not working. Stick the following in your @config.ru@, and you\'ll get something more useful than you\'ll find in the Apache logs:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  log = File.new(\"log/sinatra.log\", \"w\")\n  STDOUT.reopen(log)\n  STDERR.reopen(log)\n</pre>\n\nh3.

So I fired up Google and a text editor and started hacking away.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nh3. Enter Sinatra\n\nThe most pleasant part of this whole experience was picking up \"Sinatra\":http://sinatrarb.com, a minimal Ruby web framework that hearkens back to the simpler days of shoving a bunch of Perl into a CGI script and calling it a day. Like the CGI script of yore, you can easily stuff a small app into a single file. Unlike that CGI script, Sinatra lends itself well to MVC(Model View Controller) separation, test- or spec-driven development, and other modern programming conveniences. It\'s ideal for slapping a quick user interface on some Ruby code.\n\nSinatra\'s \"readme\":http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html is a great drink-from-the-firehose introduction to what the framework can do, but the minimal \"hello world\" application on Sinatra\'s home page is a bit _too_ minimal to be instructive. There are some great tutorials listed on the Sinatra site, though. In particular, I found \"Building an iPhone web app in under 50 lines with Sinatra and iUI\":http://devver.net/blog/2008/11/building-a-iphone-web-app-in-under-50-lines-with-sinatra-and-iui/ to be just the ticket for quickly getting up to speed on what Sinatra does. As an added bonus, it\'s got iPhone stuff in it, which is worth at least two squares in Buzzword Bingo.\n\nh3. Dreamhost, prepare to be boarded\n\nThe first step is to make a domain in the Dreamhost panel and configure it to run Passenger. From what I\'ve been reading, Passenger isn\'t really set up to run apps in a subdirectory (like @example.com/myapp@), so a new subdomain is the way to go here (like @myapp.example.com@). Dreamhost lets you define as many subdomains as you want, so this isn\'t a problem; just click *Add New Domain / Sub-Domain* in the *Domains* > *Manage Domains* screen.\n\n!http://blog.nyerm.com/images/dh-manage-domains.png!\n\nOn the Fully Hosted page that appears, check the *Ruby on Rails Passenger* box. Then set up the web directory as you would for any other site, but add @current/public@ to the end of the path. We\'re using Capistrano to deploy the app, and Capistrano wants to deploy to a directory called @current@. Passenger expects the web directory to point to the app\'s @public@ folder. Combining those two makes a path ending in @current/public@.\n\n!http://blog.nyerm.com/images/dh-fully-hosted.png!\n\nLet Dreamhost do its thing and create the new domain. Depending on how flaky its systems are and the current phase of the moon, you may have a working subdomain in a few minutes or several hours. I failed my saving throw versus Broken Scripts and got the several hours version when I set up the domain yesterday, resulting in the dreaded @bad_httpd_conf@ error. You can sometimes force Dreamhost to rebuild your messed up httpd configuration by going back to the Fully Hosted page and just clicking the *Fully host this domain now* button. No need to change any settings on the page; apparently, performing this little ritual will kick the scripts into gear, and with luck, you\'ll have a working subdomain with Passenger running on it.\n\nWhen Dreamhost\'s scripts get around to creating the domain, they\'ll also create its web directory. You\'ll need to ssh over to your account and delete the @current@ directory that\'s there. Capistrano recreates @current@ as a symbolic link pointing to the currently deployed version of the application.\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  > cd ~/sites/sinatra-test.nyerm.com\n  > rm -rf current\n</pre>\n\nh3. Vendoring Sinatra and Rack\n\nThough it\'s possible to get your own local gem repository working on Dreamhost (and for some gems, like RMagick, necessary), I find it simpler to unpack gems required by the app into a @vendor@ folder and just deploy them with the rest of the application.\n\nAs I write this, Dreamhost doesn\'t have Sinatra installed at all, and its copy of Rack is version 0.4.0, which is incompatible with the latest Sinatra (0.9.1.1). So, I unpacked both of these gems into a @vendor@ folder. Run these commands from the root of your Sinatra project:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  > mkdir vendor\n  > cd vendor\n  > gem unpack rack\n  > gem mv rack* rack\n  > gem unpack sinatra\n  > gem mv sinatra* sinatra\n</pre>\n\nBe sure to change the @require \'sinatra\'@ line at the start of your application so it requires the vendor copy of Sinatra:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  require \'vendor/sinatra/lib/sinatra\'\n</pre>\n\nh3. Capifying and racking\n\nWith Dreamhost ready to receive your application, it\'s time to get Capistrano in on the action. First you\'ll need to create a @Capfile@ so Capistrano knows where your application\'s source is and where it should be deployed.\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  > capify .\n</pre>\n\nOpen @Capfile@ in your favorite editor and replace the sparse default contents of the file with something more like this:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  load \'deploy\' if respond_to?(:namespace)\n\n  default_run_options[:pty] = true\n  \n  # be sure to change these\n  set :user, \'username\'\n  set :domain, \'domain.com\'\n  set :application, \'myapp\'\n  \n  # the rest should be good\n  set :repository,\n      \"#{user}@#{domain}:git/#{application}.git\"\n  set :deploy_to,\n      \"/home/#{user}/#{application}.#{domain}\"\n  set :deploy_via, :remote_cache\n  set :scm, \'git\'\n  set :branch, \'master\'\n  set :git_shallow_clone, 1\n  set :scm_verbose, true\n  set :use_sudo, false\n  \n  server domain, :app, :web\n  \n  namespace :deploy do\n    task :restart do\n      run \"touch #{current_path}/tmp/restart.txt\" \n    end\n  end\n</pre>\n\nI found a number of sites with reasonable instructions for deploying Sinatra to Dreamhost, and my favorite is \"John Nunemaker\'s guide on RailsTips\":http://railstips.org/2008/12/15/deploying-sinatra-on-dreamhost-with-passenger. The @Capfile@ above is from his article, which is well worth a look.\n\nThe bits that you might need to change in the @Capfile@ here, aside from the obvious @:user@, @:domain@, and @:application@ fill-ins, are the @:repository@ and @:deploy_to@ paths. For example, I keep my personal Git repository in a directory that\'s served out by Apache so I can browse the contents. Also, my file structure has an extra @sites@ directory above the web roots, because I don\'t like the mess that Dreamhost\'s default paths make of my home directory. The appropriate portion of my @Capfile@ looks like this:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  set :repository,\n    \"#{user}@#{domain}:sites/git.nyerm.com/#{application}.git\"\n  set :deploy_to,\n    \"/home/#{user}/sites/#{application}.#{domain}\"\n</pre>\n\nThe last ingredient needed for deployment to Dreamhost is a rackup configuration file, @config.ru@. Pop open the text editor again and enter the following:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  require \'vendor/rack/lib/rack\'\n  require \'vendor/sinatra/lib/sinatra\'\n  \n  set :run, false\n  set :environment, :production\n  set :views, \"views\"\n  \n  require \'hi.rb\'\n  run Sinatra::Application\n</pre>\n\nh3. Deploying to Dreamhost\n\nCheck all your files in and push to the remote Git repository, and you should be ready to deploy with the following commands:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  > cap deploy:setup\n  > cap deploy\n</pre>\n\nAssuming you don\'t have any typos and Dreamhost is choosing to be merciful, you should now have a Sinatra app running on Dreamhost.

First you\'ll need to create a @Capfile@ so Capistrano knows where your application\'s source is and where it should be deployed.\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  > capify .\n</pre>\n\nOpen @Capfile@ in your favorite editor and replace the sparse default contents of the file with something more like this:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  load \'deploy\' if respond_to?(:namespace)\n\n  default_run_options[:pty] = true\n  \n  # be sure to change these\n  set :user, \'username\'\n  set :domain, \'domain.com\'\n  set :application, \'myapp\'\n  \n  # the rest should be good\n  set :repository,\n      \"#{user}@#{domain}:git/#{application}.git\"\n  set :deploy_to,\n      \"/home/#{user}/#{application}.#{domain}\"\n  set :deploy_via, :remote_cache\n  set :scm, \'git\'\n  set :branch, \'master\'\n  set :git_shallow_clone, 1\n  set :scm_verbose, true\n  set :use_sudo, false\n  \n  server domain, :app, :web\n  \n  namespace :deploy do\n    task :restart do\n      run \"touch #{current_path}/tmp/restart.txt\" \n    end\n  end\n</pre>\n\nI found a number of sites with reasonable instructions for deploying Sinatra to Dreamhost, and my favorite is \"John Nunemaker\'s guide on RailsTips\":http://railstips.org/2008/12/15/deploying-sinatra-on-dreamhost-with-passenger. The @Capfile@ above is from his article, which is well worth a look.\n\nThe bits that you might need to change in the @Capfile@ here, aside from the obvious @:user@, @:domain@, and @:application@ fill-ins, are the @:repository@ and @:deploy_to@ paths. For example, I keep my personal Git repository in a directory that\'s served out by Apache so I can browse the contents. Also, my file structure has an extra @sites@ directory above the web roots, because I don\'t like the mess that Dreamhost\'s default paths make of my home directory. The appropriate portion of my @Capfile@ looks like this:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  set :repository,\n    \"#{user}@#{domain}:sites/git.nyerm.com/#{application}.git\"\n  set :deploy_to,\n    \"/home/#{user}/sites/#{application}.#{domain}\"\n</pre>\n\nThe last ingredient needed for deployment to Dreamhost is a rackup configuration file, @config.ru@. Pop open the text editor again and enter the following:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  require \'vendor/rack/lib/rack\'\n  require \'vendor/sinatra/lib/sinatra\'\n  \n  set :run, false\n  set :environment, :production\n  set :views, \"views\"\n  \n  require \'hi.rb\'\n  run Sinatra::Application\n</pre>\n\nh3. Deploying to Dreamhost\n\nCheck all your files in and push to the remote Git repository, and you should be ready to deploy with the following commands:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  > cap deploy:setup\n  > cap deploy\n</pre>\n\nAssuming you don\'t have any typos and Dreamhost is choosing to be merciful, you should now have a Sinatra app running on Dreamhost. On the other hand, if like me you\'re not a divine being of pure logic, you might want to enable Rack\'s logging middleware so you have some clue what\'s not working. Stick the following in your @config.ru@, and you\'ll get something more useful than you\'ll find in the Apache logs:\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"ruby:nocontrols:nogutter\">\n  log = File.new(\"log/sinatra.log\", \"w\")\n  STDOUT.reopen(log)\n  STDERR.reopen(log)\n</pre>\n\nh3.

I have my Windows user directory (@c:\\Users\\lonnon@) set as my home directory via the HOME environment variable, but many Cygwin programs, like SSH, look for the home directory within Cygwin\'s own bizarre little directory structure, at @c:\\cygwin\\home\\lonnon@ (@/home/lonnon@ in Cygwin\'s file space). Because my .ssh directory, which contains my key files, isn\'t located where Cygwin wants it, I get a \"Permission denied (publickey)\" error when attempting to connect.\n\nThe solution was so simple, I forgot that I\'d already done it on my older laptop.

I run \"Console\":http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/ as a command prompt replacement, and I just installed it on a brand new Vista machine. Unfortunately, every time I ran it, I\'d get a security warning similar to this:\n\n!http://blog.nyerm.com/images/security-warning.gif!\n\n<!--more-->\n\nUnbeknownst to me, Windows helpfully attaches security information to files that you download, using an obscure NTFS streams mechanism about which I\'d never heard. As long as this file was flagged as a potential risk, opening it would bring up the blasted nanny dialog, regardless of how many times I unchecked the box for \"Always ask before opening this file.\"\n\nPopping open the properties for the console.exe file revealed a Security section that I\'d never seen before, at the bottom of the dialog:\n\n!http://blog.nyerm.com/images/unblock-button.jpg!\n\nUnfortunately, clicking the Unblock button did nothing. And to add further insult, re-opening the properties revealed that Windows had silently undone my handiwork; the Unblock button was still there.\n\nMuch googling later revealed that I might be able to hack around this by copying the file to a non-NTFS partition, then copying it back. I did exactly that, copying it over to my Ubuntu server and back. The Unblock button was still there, but this time when I clicked it, it stayed gone. Problem solved.\n\nThe most annoying part of this morning\'s jaunt into overprotective Windows security is that I can\'t reproduce the problem. At all. I\'ve re-downloaded Console in an attempt to recreate the error and get some screen shots for this blog post, but the newly downloaded executable behaves as if it\'s always been on my hard drive. No security messages, no silly Unblock button, no evidence at all to support the last hour or so of frustrated clicking and searching.
